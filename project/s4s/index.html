<h2 id="what-strategy-for-your-strategy">What Strategy for your Strategy?</h2>

<p>Predictability is not comparable in the oil industry and in the Internet software industry. From this obvious observation, M Reeves, C. Love and Ph Tillmans  Reeves et al. (&nbsp;

    
    
<a href="/biblio/index.html#r">[Reeves12]</a>

&nbsp;)
 derive that companies in very dissimilar competitive environment should be planning and developing their strategies in different ways.</p>

<h3 id="strategy-making-must-match-competitive-environment-nature">Strategy-Making must match competitive environment nature</h3>

<p>The oil industry holds few surprises for planners: factors are well identified and outside any single company’s control, barriers to entry are very high, no one is really in a position to change the game. In game theory terms, the oil industry is a game in complete information. By contrast, the Internet software industry is characterized by new firms suddenly popping up from nowhere. The basis of competition can be fundamentally altered without much warning. In such an environment, competitive advantage comes from reading and responding to signals faster than your rivals.</p>

<p>The strategy-making process should match the nature of the competitive environment. Obviously many factors play into strategy formulation, however two characteristics are of prime importance: predictability and malleability.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Predictability</strong> - measures how far in the future and how accurately you can confidently forecast (e.g. demand, performance, competition dynamics, etc..).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Malleability</strong> - measures to what extend you (and your competitors) can influence the industry and market.</p></li>
</ul>

    <img src="/figs/B/022.png"/> 
</figure>


<h3 id="four-strategy-making-strategies">Four Strategy-making strategies</h3>

<p>These two characteristics delineate four perspectives each corresponding to its own specific strategy-making strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Classical</strong> - little malleability, good predictability - The influencing factors of the industry you operate in are well known and identified, the competitive environment is very stable. However you barely can change the environment (e.g. due to the atomicity of each firm). The canonical strategy formulation process, as taught in business schools, assumes this very competitive environment. It is not big surprise that most strategy-making frameworks are designed for such a ’classical’ competitive environment. Within the classical perspective a company sets a goal, capitalizing from its capabilities and tries to fortify that position. Strategy aims at optimizing long-term returns and careful planning feeds multi-annual forecasts. Strategy planning hinges upon specific skills and competences – both analytic and quantitative – and usually will be carried out by a dedicated, stand-alone department.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Adapting</strong> - little malleability, very unpredictability -  A carefully crafted ’classical’ strategy can become obsolete within months or weeks. In such a volatile competitive environment flexibility and the capability to re- fine/revise plans and targets is what makes the difference. Strategy formulation must then become more agile and experimental. The best bet is to constantly and quickly, produce, rollout and test a variety of products. For instance, ZARA, the Spanish retailer, can design, manufacture and ship new products in less than two weeks. Zara assesses market reaction with small batches and if they prove a hit then ramp-up production. Operations (the capability to quickly react and adapt) is the key success factor when a company is confronted to such a competitive environment. Strategists can no longer work in isolation and on the contrary, must be tightly linked with (or embedded into) operations.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Shaping</strong> - lot of malleability, very unpredictability - this typically corresponds to new, high growth industries with low barriers to entry / high rate of innovations. Demand is very hard to predict and the course of industry can shift radically. A mature but very fragmented industry can also become a shaping environment. The strategy here consists in not trying to plan or adapt (follow) but in trying to shape the unpredictable so that it benefits to the company whatever turns out: „The best way to predict the future is to invent it” (John Scully, Chairman, Apple Computer). A typical approach is to build a complete ecosystem of customers, suppliers, complementors; to create a platform and to set standards and practices.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Visionary</strong> - lot of malleability, very predictability - sometimes not only can the future be predicted and forecast, but a single company have the power to shape the future. A visionary strategy considers that the environment is not a given but on the contrary can be modeled and distorted to its benefit.
In 1994, UPS realized that the rising of e-business and online retailers would drive an unprecedented demand for delivery services. UPS had the vision, the means and the will to make the necessary investment ($1 billion a year during several years) and to become what they later called <em>the enablers of global e-commerce</em>. UPS integrated its core package-tracking operations with those of web providers and expanded its global delivery capacity through acquisition. By 2000 UPS had captured in excess of 60% of the e-commerce delivery market.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="think-long-and-hard-before-you-choose">Think [Long and Hard] before you choose</h2>

<p>A team of researchers (&nbsp;

    
    
<a href="/biblio/index.html#l">[Lafley12]</a>

&nbsp;)
 has been wondering why does strategic planning consume so many resources and so much time while having so little impact? This would be, according to them, mainly due to strategic planning only faking scientific approach despite apparent rigor and extensive analysis. Therefore they suggest one could escape this pitfall through a seven-step decision process that systematically scans well-articulated possibilities to ensure that different options are looked at, explored and probed, before any choice is made.</p>

<h3 id="step1-frame-a-choice">Step1: Frame a choice</h3>

<p>Conventional strategy planning starts from the issue to be solved (i.e. decreasing revenues) which drives a strong tendency to get very emotional and to invest in analyzing the issues rather than working out solutions.
By contrast, the approach should consist in framing the problem as a ’choice’ (for instance by defining mutually exclusive options that could resolve the issue in question). This framing helps strategists conduct stronger analyses and the managers internalize what is truly at stake.</p>

<p>In 1990s, Procter &amp; Gamble was eager to become a major player in the global beauty care sector (their objective), still they only controlled small, down-market brands (e.g. Oil of Olay) and only addressing an aging consumer base. Rather than dwelling too much on this weakness, Procter &amp; Gamble formulated two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>dramatically transform ’Oil of Olay’ into something comparable to L’Oréal, Clarins, etc,</li>
<li>spend billions into acquiring an existing skin care brand</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step2-generate-strategic-possibilities">Step2:Generate strategic possibilities</h3>

<p>Once options are identified, the second step consists in constructing strategic possibilities (including genuinely new ones). A possibility is a ’story’ that describes how a firm might success [how the option can materialize]. It needs to be consistent and ’valid’, however it doesn’t need to be proved at that stage. Any possibility must explicit</p>

<ul>
<li>the advantage it aims to achieve or leverage,</li>
<li>the scope across which the advantage applies,</li>
<li>the activities throughout the value chain that would deliver the intended advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>This step should involve a team of people from different backgrounds and expertise while trying to avoid as much as possible people emotionally bond to the ’Status Quo’. Operational managers should take part to the complete exercise, as when planners are different from doers then what gets done is different from what get planned. Several techniques can be mobilized to work out possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>inside-out possibility generation</strong> – start with assets and capabilities and reason outward: what does this company do especially well that parts of the market might value and that might produce profit?</li>
<li><strong>outside-in possibility generation</strong> – what are the underserved needs? What are the needs that customers find hard to serve?</li>
<li><strong>far-outside-in possibility generation</strong> - what would it take to become the Google, the Apple or the WallMart of this market?</li>
</ul>

<p>A good set of possibilities must contain at least one possibility that directly questions the status quo (while being considered as feasible and bringing some interest) and at least one possibility that is far enough from the status quo (even if it is not sure it could be doable and/or safe at all).</p>

<h3 id="step3-specify-the-conditions-for-success">Step3: Specify the conditions for success</h3>

<p>In practice, this step should make explicit the conditions that need to hold true for the possibilities (identified in step 2) to be a success. This is achieved through producing declarative statements such as for possibility P to succeed, condition X must be true. Where typical conditions encompass: the industry structure, the strategic segments, consumer structure and volume, distribution channel, capabilities, costs, competitors’ likely reactions. (for instance ’Channel partners will support us’).</p>

<p>When the list of conditions is established, it should be screened again to eliminate all the nice to have conditions while keeping the must-have.</p>

<p>At that stage one should refrain from being judgmental and/or expressing their opinions about whether a condition is true or not. The only question is whether or not one would advocate for this possibility, provided that all the conditions were true.</p>

<h3 id="step4-identify-barriers-to-choice">Step4: Identify barriers to choice</h3>

<p>Once conditions are identified, one must determine which are more likely to hold true. Typically one would ask each teammate to raise their concerns and to rank the conditions by likelihood. More often than not there will be a consensus on most conditions (either that they hold true or that they don’t).</p>

<p>However the group may have contrasted opinions on a few conditions. Pay close attention on these conditions and also on the people who are the most skeptical: they will be the biggest barriers (potentially a valid obstacle in case of problematic possibilities).</p>

<h3 id="step5-design-test-for-barrier-conditions">Step5: Design test for barrier conditions</h3>

<p>Once the key barriers have been identified they must be tested to determine whether they can hold true or not. Several techniques can be mobilized: survey, data crunching and interviews.</p>

<p>The teammate who is the most skeptical about a given condition should design and lead the test for that condition, as this person will have the highest standard of proof.</p>

<h3 id="step6-conduct-the-tests">Step6: Conduct the tests</h3>

<p>At that stage, all the conditions must be checked according to the test protocols defined at step 5. Probing the conditions in the reverse order of confidence – the lazy’s man approach to choice – often turns out to be the most efficient. Indeed as soon as a condition appears to be false, the associated possibility can be eliminated (and there is no need to further test the conditions that are a prerequisite to that possibility only).</p>

<h3 id="step7-make-choice">Step7: Make choice</h3>

<p>With the possibilities-based approach, making the final decision – that is deciding the strategy – only requires choosing the possibility that remains when all barriers have been identified and tested.</p>
