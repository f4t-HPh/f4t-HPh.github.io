	"content": "   Purpose About this Lecture Notes Strategic Management is now a well-established academic discipline that encompasses a fast-growing literature and a considerable number of widely acclaimed models to elaborate strategies. However, the daily practice of strategic management sometimes deviates from theoretical prescriptions.\nSeveral factors may explain these deviations (or even distortions): difficulties in implementing theoretical frameworks, lack of knowledge from practitioners, or even sometimes the mere conviction that theoretical models are of little interest.\nThe class must be seen as a Practitioner\u0026rsquo;s View on strategy. It aims at giving some insight into how to formulate, articulate and implement strategies in firms. This will also be the occasion to reflect on the role of strategists in firms and/or consultancies.\nNeither the class nor these notes are trying to be comprehensive and many aspects will not be covered. However, this Wiki will meet its objectives if it makes you think about some of the many issues of strategy elaboration, perhaps brings you to question the standard solutions and above all, invites you to seek your own answers.\nWhy This Blog-let? Designing suitable slides is always a dilemma (\u0026nbsp; [Duarte] \u0026nbsp;) . Slides can be made self-sufficient and self-readable, but if so, what is the point of presenting them? By contrast, one can prepare more visual, possibly more enjoyable, slides that focus on the most salient points but are of little use without additional explanations and can barely be referred to, outside the class.\nMy preferred solution to escape this dilemma is to have both slides for the class and additional lecture notes (usually covering more aspects that can be discussed during the class). Students can then decide to revise some of the notions after the class.\nHow is the course built? It is primarily about \u0026lsquo;Thinking\u0026rsquo; In what is called Instructional Teaching, students are exposed to a clear body of knowledge and trained to apply established procedures. De Wit \u0026amp; Meyer (\u0026nbsp; [deWit10] \u0026nbsp;) stress that with typical \u0026lsquo;tool-oriented\u0026rsquo; classes, the priority is on accept, absorb \u0026amp; apply.\nBy contrast, a \u0026lsquo;decision-oriented\u0026rsquo; approach seeks to stimulate critical thinking, y exploring the various theories, challenging their limits and pitfalls and encourage students to derive their own models.\n „Strategic thinking is in its very essence questioning, challenging unconventional and innovative” \u0026mdash; B. De Wit and R. Meyer.\n The course presents the main elements of standard theories but also seeks to establish links between the different points of view and techniques.\nAs noted by Besanko (\u0026nbsp; [Besanko13] \u0026nbsp;) several famous business books that address Strategy \u0026ldquo;derive their recommendations by studying the past performance of successful firms\u0026rdquo;. They mostly rely on the proof by assertion fallacy (aka Ipse dixit - it is true because it is claimed to be true). They describe a few casual observations and then claim assertion of the forms these successful companies do \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;, therefore \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; is the source of their success.\nRather than trying to give miracle recipes, these pages seek to arouse curiosity and stimulate the critical mind of readers. It may seem less exciting and more tedious, but the goal is to develop an independent thought and allow to form one\u0026rsquo;s own opinion.\nCopyright Author, Actor or Assembler Strictly speaking, I am the author of these pages, as I wrote them. However I borrowed many aspects from various books and articles (including some verbatim). Therefore I\u0026rsquo;m also a curator or assembler of existing texts.\nIndeed, this site aims at sharing my personal experience and thoughts as well as providing students with reference elements \u0026amp; materials that I have found useful as a practitioner. I normally stress very clearly in the text when I refer to existing materials or quote scholars.\nCredits The site draws from my readings and hands-on experience over the years. I give credit when credit is due, however, and despite the efforts, I may have unwillingly missed some references and/or forgotten some sources.

	"content": " A SWOT chart can be used in a wide variety of situations, which makes it very attractive. It can for instance help evaluating the effectiveness of the existing strategy of an organization (and defining how the strategy should be refined/adapted to changes in the environment). Adequately used, a SWOT can also be very powerful to guide the analysis and very effective to present findings.\nThe quality of the outputs however, may suffer when the analysis is too superficial. Improperly conducted, a SWOT analysis can be extremely subjective and misleading. Applying a SWOT on the wrong scope, failing to consider the dynamic or weak signals are among the major pitfalls.\nWhere not to start Barney (\u0026nbsp; [Barney91] \u0026nbsp;) notes that the well-known SWOT framework prompts to consider the strengths and weaknesses of a firm and match them with the opportunities and threats. However as the framework doesn’t suggest how strengths can be identified and appraised, SWOT sessions often turns into generating lists of what the firm is “good at” and “not so good at”.\n  By contrast, a SWOT should thoroughly examine: - The External environment: its complexity and dynamic evolutions, - The Organization’s capabilities: what are the resources that can be mobilized by the firm. Conversely, what resources may be lacking? - The Organization’s strategic purpose: what is the organization seeking to achieve? What are the criteria against which strategies must be evaluated? - The Organization’s culture: what are the risk of strategic drift (i.e. failure to create the necessary momentum for change).\nThe SWOT matrix is a good way to present findings. However other tools must be mobilized to perform the analysis and record facts and beliefs. Some of such tools and the way to use them are reminded in the following pages.\nThe matrix should be the result, not the starting point In is not uncommon to try producing directly the SWOT matrix. At best it results in unjustified statements, if not false perceptions of both the environment and strategic capacities of the firm.\nHowever it can sometimes be useful to try (and fail) to fill a SWOT grid from scratch with the project contributors. Indeed it can be a way to raise their awareness that there are many unknowns and that a sound analysis is mandatory. However, there is always the risks that people consider that the initial SWOT is sufficient and become reluctant to continue and deepen the analysis. Directly feeding the matrix can also contribute to anchor judgmental feelings.\nThe empty matrix – which is best known and supposedly well understood – can also be a way to explain why further analysis is needed and to introduce specific tools and analyses. The most suited combination of tools and techniques highly depends on the problem to solve, the project contributors and the available timeframe. Common tools that can be used to appraise the external and internal environments are quickly reviewed hereafter, with a focus on how to use them in practice.\nThe PESTEL, 5 Forces and Resource \u0026amp; Competence frameworks are among the most common tools that can be used to prepare a sound SWOT analysis.\n  There are however some pitfalls or common mistakes:\n Scope It is very easy to misidentify the right boundaries of the industry. If the scope is too wide the analysis becomes non-specific, too general and averaged. If on the contrary, it is too narrow then it can miss trends, weak signals and remains trapped in the status quo.\n Depth Remaining too superficial and oversimplifying the situation (jumping directly to the conclusions). If you don’t learn something new from the analysis, you probably missed something.\n Key factors Failing to bring out the most salient points. The aim of the analysis is to scan many items and then to down select a few factors that can “explain” the environment and its dynamic. Buzzwords \u0026amp; jargon should also be avoided as much as possible.\n  The SWOT matrix should be used to summarize the findings of more detailed analyses. It should not be a starting point.\n "

	"content": " “ Begin at the beginning ” the King said gravely, go on till you come to the end and then stop.\n LEWIS CAROLL - ALICE IN WONDERLAND  Uncovering the essence of strategy far exceeds the purpose of this course and a mere attempt to do so in here, could rightly be considered both pretentious and futile.\nYet, one can hardly consider strategy as a practice, without questioning its foundations: What do we mean by strategy? Why is strategy needed at all?\nThe word strategy has been around for a long time and is being used frequently but what does it really mean ?\nAlthough these questions may sound trivial, the lack of unanimously accepted answers has genuine consequences for practitioners. This section briefly explores why defining the word “strategy” in a way that is unambiguous and accepted by everybody, is so difficult. It also suggests how practitioners can overcome the hurdle\nThe practice of strategy requires both rigorous analysis methods and efficient means of leadership, communication, and management. Academic models often focus on the former while not addressing the later. This is one of the main gaps that practical models are seeking to fill. Besides, elaborating and implementing a new strategy is as much (if not more) a social process than an intellectual effort. Little can be achieved without the involvement and commitment of many stakeholders.\n  "

	"content": " The Ansoff\u0026rsquo;s Matrix The famous Ansoff’s matrix was first published in 1957 in the Harvard Business Review. It portrays the four alternative growth strategies, by considering existing products vs. new products, and existing markets vs. new markets.\n  Market penetration consists in increasing the business through offering the same product/service to the same market. Market development and Product development are sometimes called related diversification (or adjacent diversification). The idea here is to either offer new products to existing customers or to propose existing products to new markets. Product development is the most challenging option.\nMarket Penetration With Market Penetration, the firm seeks to achieve growth with existing products / services in their current market segments, aiming to increase its market share. It is the least risky strategy since it leverages many of the firm’s existing resources and it requires no change in strategic capabilities\nIn a growing market, simply maintaining market share will result in growth, and there may exist opportunities to increase market share if competitors reach capacity limits. Usually more business volume translates into some cost efficiency. However, market penetration has limits, and once the market approaches saturation another strategy must be pursued if the firm is to continue to grow.\nThere are two major downsides to Market Penetration:\n Retaliation from competitors rivalry among competitors is likely to get exacerbated, especially in mature markets. Market penetration in low- growth markets often triggers horizontal integration and consolidation (one of the player seeks to acquire its competitors).\n Legal constraints Anti trust regulations aims at limiting market power. Therefore authorities are likely to prevent consolidation beyond a certain limit.\n  Note: Retrenchment (a firm deciding to withdraw from a less attractive market) is the opposite to market penetration.\nProduct Development With Product Development the firm develops new products and/or services – i.e. with different technologies – targeted to its existing market segments.\nA product development strategy may be appropriate if the firm’s strengths are related to its specific customers rather than to the specific product itself (i.e. customer bonding, customer relationship, available customer data, \u0026hellip;). In this situation, the company can leverage its strengths by developing a new product /service targeted to its existing customers.\nDepending on the degree of relatedness, Product Development may imply acquiring/developing new strategic capabilities (e.g. new processes, new technologies, new know how, etc). Therefore it usually carries more risk (e.g. delays, cost overruns, failure) than simply attempting to increase market share.\nMarket development With Market Development the firm seeks growth by targeting its existing products to new market segments.\nMarket development options include the pursuit of additional market segments (e.g. addressing additional user needs) or geographical regions (including internationalization).\nThe development of new markets for the product may be a good strategy if the firm’s core competencies are related more to the specific product than to its experience with a specific market segment. Because the firm is expanding into a new market, a market development strategy typically has more risk than a market penetration strategy.\nDiversification With Diversification the firm grows by diversifying into new businesses by developing new products for new markets.\nDiversification is the most risky of the four growth strategies since it requires both product and market development and may be outside the core competencies of the firm. However, diversification may be a reasonable choice if the high risk is compensated by the chance of a high rate of return.\nOther advantages of diversification include the potential to gain a foothold in an attractive industry and the reduction of overall business portfolio risk.\nDiversification can occur at business level (expanding to new segments of the industry) or at corporate level (entering new businesses out of the scope of current activities). Differentiating diversification from market development or product development can be however rather subjective, as it depends on the way “new product” and “new market” are interpreted.\nIt is usually considered that there is diversification when and if a firms tries to develop a new strategic segment, which usually requires new capabilities. Although diversification can be accessible through pure organic growth (developing existing resources \u0026amp; competence), it is often associated with external growth and, in that case usually requires Mergers \u0026amp; Acquisitions and/or Alliances.\n"

	"content": " Designing an appropriate model of reality With all Strategic Frameworks, the secret reside in building a model, a simplified view of reality to highlight the key influencing factors.\n  The puppet here above has legs with no knee-articulation. If such articulations would be significant for the situation under analysis, the model would be over- simplified. By contrast, adding articulations if not significant at the first order, would bring unnecessarily complexity in the model.\nIt usually takes a lot of time and effort to deeply understand the various relationships between external and/or internal factors. To build on the puppet analogy, the first model usually looks like a very detailed (and often unbalanced) representation with too many strings. The biggest challenge then consists in reducing the model to its essence.\n „It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away ” (Antoine de Saint Exupery)\n Delineate the environment The environment (aka organization’s ecosystem) creates opportunities for the firm but also presents threats.\n  Draw the big picture The first stage in understanding the environment is to delineate the industry or industries, which requires identifying the categories of players, their activities and relationships. It is preferable to start with simplistic models (accepting to remain vague and imprecise) rather than immediately trying to formalize value systems. The objective is not yet to perform an external analysis but rather to define the boundaries.\nIt is always a good idea to first widen the scope. Indeed many industries are converging (former distinct industries are now becoming a single industry). Furthermore, customers of an industry may consider alternative products or services offered by different industries. In that case, competition (and therefore opportunities and threats) extends beyond the boundaries of the currently accepted industry.\n  Qualitative information can then be gathered for each and every top-level element. Several sources can be considered to obtain such information: - Annual reports, press releases, and web site of the main players, - Interviews of experts - Industry reports and statistics (professional association, governmental bodies, consultancies)\nCompetitors that are present in more than one industry, may derive a competitive advantage by combining several strategic capabilities or be in position to better benefit from evolutions of the macro-environment.\n  Quantitative information for instance about the main flows are very helpful to seize the big picture.\nDefining the industry Strategic analysis is about understanding how to over-perform and do better than other players. It is therefore paramount to precisely understand where you compete, what is you industry or competitive arena.\nAn Industry  is a group of firms offering products and services that are essentially the same (i.e. are highly substitutable).\n Understanding the industry may sounds easy and straightforward, but it is on the trickiest aspect in strategy analysis. Economists have classified industries (economical sectors) according to the number of players in the industry\n Monopoly a specific organization is the only supplier of a product or service. A monopoly can be de facto (unique resource, patent, etc\u0026hellip;) or de jure when it is established by law by a government or state. In many countries, competition law restrict dominant position and monopolies. Oligopoly a small number of firms dominate and control the market. Oligopolies can result from various forms of collusion (e.g. Cartel) and lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced competition among firms. Perfect competition a vast number of players are supplying the goods and services. The market power of each individual player is very limited. No single player can influence the market (price taker). Hyper competition is an extreme case of perfect competition characterized by the absence of barriers to entry and to exit. As a result there is a lot of very strong competition among companies, market are changing rapidly. It is not possible for one organization to derive and keep a sustainable competitive advantage.  Defining Market segments An industry can be made up of several specific market segments and more of- ten than not a single industry addresses several market segments.\nA Market Segment  is a group of customers who have similar needs that are different from customer needs in other parts of the market.\n A niche is a small segment with very few customers / business volume compared to the main market.\nA strategic customer is an organization that have the most influence over which services/goods are purchased. For instance, in the food industry, retailers are more strategic (mainly mean important here) than final customers as they decide what to purchase and distribute.\nDefining Strategic groups Conversely service/product providers can be segmented into several strategic groups.\nA Strategic Group  is a subset of organizations within an industry that share similar strategic characteristics, follow similar strategies or compete on similar bases.\n There exist many ways to characterize strategic groups for instance:\n extend of product (or service) diversity, extend of geographical coverage number of different market segments served distribution channels and branding extend and scope of vertical integration grade of service (perceived quality) technology leadership size of the organization  Strategic groups are usually mapped onto two-dimensional charts (i.e. only two key factors are considered) to stress the difference between the highest and lowest performer, for instance it is useful in\n Better understanding competition the 5-forces may apply differently to different strategic groups,\n Unveil strategic opportunities some spaces may be more attractive than others, or may remain unoccupied (however there might be good reasons for that if the space correspond to a black hole impossible to exploit).\n Analysis of mobility barriers usually strategic groups are characterized by obstacles to movement from one group to another.\n  The strategic group concept helps with understanding the similarities and dif- ferences in term of competition characteristics.\n"

	"content": " Even when it is explicitly formulated, a strategy does include detailed actions for all stakeholders. On the contrary, it should focus on top level considerations and ensure alignment, while leaving a lot of freeway to the people in charge of executing.\n  Organization alignment D. Sull \u0026amp; K.M. Eisenhardt (\u0026nbsp; [Sull15] \u0026nbsp;) have rightly pointed out that if an organization’s strategy lives on the shelf then this organization has a problem. How to bridge the gap between strategy and execution? According to them, by polishing simple statements that help making on-the-spot decisions and adapting to rapidly changing circumstances\nIndeed, they argue that while a checklist or any other process adherence technique is usually well adapted in repetitive situation (e.g. safety control) to ensure the activities alignment with corporate objectives. Agreeing on a simple ’principle’ is more adequate in more dynamic environment however, where flexibility is important. Process operators can then decide the most appropriate action to cope with the principle, subject to the actual circumstances.\nIn A.C. Hax’s words the true purpose [of the strategy statement] is to capture and clearly articulate our intent. Strategy is a fundamental vehicle to communicate our sense of direction, both inside and outside the organization. It aims to give purpose and direction to an organization and end up with the proper implementation of a well-designed strategy.\nThis simple idea of not trying to fix in advance every tiny detail was made famous by D. Eisenhower who claimed No plan survive the first contact with the enemy.\n  Chip \u0026amp; Dan Heath (\u0026nbsp; [Heath07] \u0026nbsp;) hammer on the message. The planning process forces people to think through the right issues, however even if you may start off trying to fight your plan, the enemy gets a vote.\nIn the 80’s the Army invented the concept of CI (Commander’s intend): a crisp, plain-talk statement, specifying the goal, the desired end-state. You can lose the ability to execute the original plan but you never lose the responsibility of executing the CI.\nThe commander’s intend should phrase something like if we do nothing else, we must : xxx or something like the single most important thing is: xx.\nCompelling stories \u0026amp; Catch phrases The hard part in producing such a statement is weeding out ideas that are important but not the most important. Finding the core is about discarding a lot of insights to let shine the most important insight. Consistently repeating a simple statement (or intent) is the best way to ensure that all the stakeholders in the organization receive the message and then make appropriate decisions.\nChip \u0026amp; Dan Heath quote this story from Herb Kelleher, the CEO of SouthWest : *„Tracy from marketing comes into my office and she says that surveys show that the passengers might enjoy a Cesar salad on the Houston to Las Vegas flight. What do you answer? You respond: Tracy, will adding that chicken salad make us THE low-cost airline from Houston to Vegas? Because if it doesn’t help us become the unchallenged low-cost airline, then we’re not serving any damn chicken salad.*” (Southwest’s CEO)\nNo one knows if there ever existed a Tracy in Southwest Marketing, but the story drives the point home: Southwest is THE low-cost company. Southwest has been very consistent in its intent over the years and has also been one of the only consistently profitable airline for more than 30 years.\n  Telling stories is also a way to make sure the staff can remember and feel the purpose of a strategic move. According to J. Conger (\u0026nbsp; [Conger08] \u0026nbsp;) Herb Kelleher used to tell the following story when visiting his operations across the United States: „It’s funny, I get letters all the time from shareholders and they’re often angry letters. They say : ’American West is flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for $149 one way. And you, Herb Kelleher at Southwest, are pricing $79 for that same one-way ticket. Don’t you have the decency to at least kick your price up to $129 ? Why are you leaving so much on the table ?’ Well, what I do is write and reply : Thank you so much for your letter. However you don’t understand who we are, and you really don’t understand who our competition is. It’s automobile; it’s not other airlines. And $79 is the price to drive, including maintenance, insurance and gasoline, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. That’s how we price or ticket. ” (Southwest’s CEO)\n"

	"content": " Strategy elaboration is likely to mobilize a wide variety of techniques, involve staff from various functional origins and last from a few weeks to several months. It is therefore paramount to plan and organize the work to ensure that resources and means are aligned with expectations and constraints.\nPreparing a report, within a week, on the structure of an industry is not comparable with elaborating, along several months, a full diversification strategy. These differences must be reflected in the way resources are allocated and the work is planned.\nMain Artifacts As already mentioned there is no magic formula, no ready to use recipe. Con- sequently the artifacts to be generated (documents, dossiers, deliverables, etc.) are highly dependent on the specific context, and predefined lists of deliverables would be of little use.\nNevertheless, it is highly advisable, when preparing a specific deliverable to consider that it should belong to exactly one of the five following categories of artifacts. Indeed, mixing or messing the categories (i.e. using a deliverable for the wrong purpose or failing to calibrate the deliverable - which is one of the most frequent pitfalls) can be very detrimental.\n  Artifacts should fall into one of the following categories:\n Organize the work - this category addresses neither the solution, nor the problem. It exclusively deals with problem-solving aspects. Artifacts from this category can include the description of the specific elaboration process, the definition of responsibilities among contributors, templates \u0026amp; guidelines to be used for the production of other deliverables. In other words, it deals with planning the project of strategy-making.\n Brainstorm ideas - elaborating strategies requires creativity, exchanges and challenging ideas. Several tools \u0026amp; techniques can be used to stimulate and trace such exchanges. The resulting outputs must be seen as intermediate products. These outputs do contribute to strategy elaboration although they should not be confused with recommendations. Some of these items can populate the ’facts \u0026amp; beliefs’ categories. In such instances, it can be advisable to double check and/or look for complementary information. It is also usually necessary to reword and restructure the various items.\n Register facts \u0026amp; beliefs - it is mandatory (although often overlooked) to register \u0026amp; trace the various facts and beliefs upon which a strategy is built. For each item, the source (or origin) of the information and possibly a factor of confidence must also be recorded. In some cases, simple lists or tables can be sufficient. In other instances a structured database can be more appropriate. When quantitative data are computed from large sources (data crunching) it is advisable to keep a copy of the original data and the computation formulas, in case it would need to be revisited.\n Findings - based on ideas, beliefs and facts, strategists prepare findings. Findings are not yet recommendations. They consist in synthetics views drawn from the various elementary items previously gathered. Findings are very often presented as matrices \u0026amp; charts with the objective of offering synthetic and visual understanding of a situation. It can sometimes trigger further analysis when outcomes must be confirmed or consolidated. A very common pitfall, is to confuse \u0026ldquo;findings\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;recommendations\u0026rdquo;.\n Recommendation - is the main outcomes of strategy elaboration. Findings are used to justify and illustrate the recommendations. However recommendations should not consist in a series of ’findings’ (typically matrices, graphs, figures, etc). On the contrary, a strategic recommendation should tell a story. It should be intelligible for all stakeholders (in particular for those who don’t understand the jargon of strategy).\n  "

	"content": " Intro  Corporate Strategy refers to the strategy that multi-business corporations use to compete as a collection of multiple businesses. It is qualitatively different from strategy for a single-business or business strategy. (\u0026nbsp; [Puranam16] \u0026nbsp;)  Corporate Strategy being about multi-businesses, it becomes key to define what a business is. The usual accepted definition is that a business is characterized by its business model. So if a firm addresses different segments of customers with radically different value propositions or value architecture, then it is a multiple-business firm.\nNow reality, as ever, can be rather blurry. A multi-national firm can be seen as comprising different businesses (e.g. multi-domestic firms) or on the contrary as offering worldwide a single value proposition (e.g. trading firm).\nLikewise, when the launch of a new product requires tremendous investment (e.g. aircraft programme), it can be viewed as a business in its own right, although the business model remains unchanged.\nCorporate advantage For Corporate Strategy, a firm competes with other potential owners for businesses. There are two central questions:\n is the firm the best owner for a given business (i.e. would worth more to someone else),\n how can you obtain \u0026ldquo;corporate advantage\u0026rdquo; i.e.yield more value by combining several businesses\n  A firm has Corporate advantage if owning together the two businesses A and B, yields more value than the sum of the value of the businesses owned separately - that is V[AB] \u0026gt; V(A) + V(B).\n Businesses can be owned jointly or operated jointly Two types of players are involved in Corporate Strategy : financial investors (assemble portfolio i.e. acquire cash flow rights over returns but with limited decision rights) and strategic investors (operate and modify the acquired businesses).\nWhen Value is measured as an NPV (investment logic), there are two ways to improve the NPV: by increasing future cash flows or by decreasing the dicount rate.\nYou can create corporate advantage through selection of a good business portfolio (risk diversification)\nCreating Value through diversification [unrelated businesses, same risk profile =\u0026gt; same expected return with lower risk profile = less extreme payments]\n3 Companies (500, 1\u0026frasl;2) - (0, 1\u0026frasl;2) -\u0026gt; 1\u0026frasl;3 (1500, 1\u0026frasl;6), (1000, 1\u0026frasl;3), (500, 1\u0026frasl;3) , (0, 1\u0026frasl;6) -\u0026gt; same average (expected value), less extreme payments -\u0026gt; lower the risk of \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo; -\u0026gt; decrease the discount rate\nWhy would a financial investor acquire a company:\n Buy an under-evaluated company and resell it at its true value,\n Buy a company and sell it in parts, (when the sum of the part is less than the parts),\n Buy a company, restructure it and resell\n  Synergies While a financial investor can only impact the discount rates by reducing and diversifying risks, a strategic investor can change the cash flows (e.g. by increasing revenues or decreasing costs) or their timing.\nOperational synergy means that two businesses operated jointly (decisions are coordinated) are more valuable than operated independently. This can sometimes be achieved through strategic partnerships, but usually requires common ownership.\nOther reasons (non-operational synergies): - market access - resource access (talent, financing, raw material, IP, \u0026hellip;) - Tax optimization\nOperational synergies can be characterized according to two dimensions: the level of similarity of the underlying resources (are we linking similar or dissimilar resources when two businesses are jointly operated) and the extend of required modification.\nThis may seem trivial but assessing the right level can be extremely challenging (particularly for a business that is insufficiently know / understood ).\nADD GRAPHIC\nFour quadrants: consolidation, combination, Connection, Customization\nIf resources are very similar (at the extreme identical - case of horizontal merger), then economies of scale might be experienced which will translate into higher performance and value creation.\nseparatly If resources are somehow related, while not strictly identical, economies of scope are likely to be experience, which again can translate into value correlations\nIf resources are very distinct (e.g. conglomerate merger) then it might become more challenging to generate higher performance by operating the two businesses together.\nComplex value chains can exhibit partial similarity (e.g. similar retail networks) while being different at the same time (dissimilar R\u0026amp;D).\nThe extent of modification represents the amount of post-merger change (frictions) that is required to operate jointly the two businesses (e.g. suppress duplicate, integrate processes or information systems).

	"content": " What does Strategy mean? “Strategy” in everyday’s conversations In everyday conversations the word strategy far exceeds the domain of strategic management. Considering just a glimpse of the many different meanings, at least three specific contexts can be stressed, in addition to strategic management: strategic thinking, problem solving and important things.\n   Strategy for Important it is very common to hear about strategic customers, strategic suppliers, strategic country, strategic campaign, strategic project, etc. More often than not, the adjective strategic stands here for ‘important’ and unless evidence of scarcity, uncertainty or decision can be found, such situations have only very remote resemblance with strategic management.   Strategic customer must usually be understood as important customer, except maybe When that customer is an opinion leader for the industry that can influence other customers and change the game.\n  Strategy for Problem Solving the word strategy is also commonly used to mean way to solve a problem (i.e. \u0026lsquo;a plan\u0026rsquo; or what behavioral scientists and computer scientists call a heuristic).     In the above example Strategies for organizing items in the garage sounds great but must be a bit remote from strategic management.\n Strategic Management To paraphrase Andrew (\u0026nbsp; [Andrews87] \u0026nbsp;) Strategic management is the pattern of decisions in a company that determines and reveals its objectives, purposes or goals, produces the principal policies and plans for achieving those goals, and defines the range of business the company is to pursue, the kind of economic and human organisation it is or intends to be , and the nature of the economic and non-economic contribution it intends to make to its shareholders, employees, customers and communities\u0026rdquo;.\n Strategic Management is concerned with relating firm to its environment, to successfully meet long-term objectives. (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  Strategy Management can be broadly divided into too aspects: Business Strategy and Corporate Strategy.\n  Business Strategy addresses the question of How to be successful in individual markets, for each business unit. It focuses on how to compete (as well as to how to avoid competition).\n Business strategy is the determination of how a company will compete in a given business and position itself among its competitors. - (\u0026nbsp; [Andrews87] \u0026nbsp;)  Corporate Strategy applies to firms that own several businesses. The central question of Corporate Strategy is \u0026ldquo;how a collection of businesses owned by a single firm, creates more value than the sum of its parts\u0026rdquo;. It deals with clarifying how the mother company provides support to its business units and increases the total value.\n Corporate Strategy refers to the strategy that multi-business corporations use to compete as a collection of multiple businesses. - (\u0026nbsp; [Puranam16] \u0026nbsp;)  Strategic decisions are complex problems As underlined in (\u0026nbsp; [Robertson] \u0026nbsp;) social science has identified three different levels of decisions in organization .\n Technical decisions (including operating procedures) supported by strong and explicit body of knowledge, correspond to situations where a solution can be derived given certain premises.\n Managerial Decisions deal with situations where complexity is such that it cannot be sorted as a technical problem and short cuts based on experience and heuristics (aka rules of thumb) must be taken.\n Strategic decisions concern situations characterized by their high complexity, (they relate to problems with multiple and related dimensions) and their high uncertainty (they are characterized by the interdependent behaviour of different actors).\n  A critical task of upper-level management involves the identification and structuring of the most important problems threatening the organization\u0026rsquo;s ability to survive and adapt in the future.\n These are not the everyday, routine problems but the problems and issues that are unique, important and frequently ambiguous (McCaskey, 1982). Mason and Mitroff (1981) specify the characteristics of these vexing strategic problems, which they call \u0026lsquo;wicked problems.\u0026rsquo; They are distinguished by interconnectedness to other problems, complexity with recursive feedback, uncertainty in a dynamic environment, ambiguity dependent on viewpoint, conflicting trade-offs of alternative solutions, and societal constraints to theoretical solutions. Every problem is inextricably united to the environment in which it is embedded. [Problem formulation - and organizational decision-making - Marjorie A. Lyles]\n Tools and Problem-solving perspectives The first MBA program was created at Harvard in 1908. Since then, management literature has built up and many management tools (or Business Fads as Richard Pascale of the Saïd Oxford Business School, calls them) have developed. Temptation can be high to predominantly focus on tools under the expectation that they can solve it all.\n  As stressed by B. De Wit \u0026amp; Ron Meyer (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;) \u0026ldquo;Strategy\u0026rdquo; can be considered from either a tool perspective or a problem-driven perspective. With the tool approach, the focus is on understanding and learning the various instruments that can be mobilized. By contrast, the problem-driven approach first addresses what is at stake, without initially considering how to solve it.\n There is no \u0026ldquo;silver bullet\u0026rdquo; for strategizing and therefore, we seek to adopt the problem-solving perspective, in these pages: understanding the problem comes first and looking for available tools to solve it comes next.\n Bad Strategies The assimilation of strategizing with the (more or less fuzzy) implementation of business fads is the central topic of Good Bad / Bad Strategy by R. Rumelt of UCLA Anderson School of Management. (\u0026nbsp; [Rumelt11] \u0026nbsp;)  “A good strategy does more than urge us forward toward a goal or vision; it honestly acknowledges the challenges we face and provides an approach to overcoming them.” - Rumelt\n   According to Rumelt, a (good) strategy identifies the one or two critical issues or challenges in a situation — the pivot points that can multiply the effectiveness of effort — depicts a way to deal with them and then focuses and concentrates actions and resources. As a result, a (good) strategy must clearly\n Understand the situation and simplify the complexity of reality down to actionable factors,\n Identify the challenge(s) or roadblock or obstacles that must be overcome, \u0026ldquo;What’s holding you back from reaching your goals? A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality down to a simpler story by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical. A good diagnosis often uses a metaphor, analogy, or an existing accepted framework to make it simple and understandable, which then suggests a domain of action\u0026rdquo;.\n Define a guiding policy cope with obstacles. While the guiding policy doesn\u0026rsquo;t describe the details of what exactly should be carried out, it directs and constraints the course of actions (like guardrails along motorways) Furthermore strategy execution should rely on a set of synergetic actions, that is mutually reinforcing.\n Articulate a compelling story to explain what obstacles must be dealt with, through what actions and for what expected result. A good strategy must be simple and obvious. It must be designed to be highly coherent and must focus the organisation toward a consistent result.\n   “A strategy is a way through a difficulty, an approach to overcoming an obstacle, a response to a challenge. If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have a stretch goal or a budget or a list of things you wish would happen.“\n By contrast, a bad strategy will usually consists in\n a list of unconnected priorities (aka Dog\u0026rsquo;s dinner Objectives in Rumelt\u0026rsquo;s terms) that don\u0026rsquo;t support each other (if not conflict with or undermine each other). A long list of things to do, often mislabeled as strategies or objectives, is not a strategy.\n a statement of desire rather than a plan to overcome obstacles. A second type of weak strategic objective is one that is “blue sky”—typically. A simple restatement of the desired state of affairs or of the challenge - or a “blue sky” business vision- is not a Strategy as it skips over the annoying fact that no one has a clue as to how to get there.\n the failure to face a challenge characterized by little (if any) understanding of the situation and the absence of obstacle identifications. When a company makes the kind of jump in performance your plan envisions, there is usually a key strength you are building on or a change in the industry that opens up new opportunities. Can you clarify what the point of leverage might be here, in your company?\n the use of fluff \u0026amp; jargon as well as inflated words and gibberish to create the illusion of high-level thinking.\n  Rumelt stresses that in many instances, strategizing (doing the hard work of understanding the situation, identifying key challenges, creating a guiding policy and defining actions to overcome the challenges) is replace by a template-style strategic planning exercise.\nFirst a Vision is sketched (what the firm wants to be like in the future) which often starts with “the best” or “the leading.” Then a Mission (the purpose of the firm) is phrased in high-sounding and politically correct terms, completed by Values (non-controversial and usually very trendy). Strategies are then defined as some aspirations/goals. Besides, Rumelt notes that the vision, mission, and goals are usually statements that no one would argue against, but that no one is really inspired by, either.\nThe commander intent Even when it is explicitly formulated, a strategy does include detailed actions for all stakeholders. On the contrary, it should focus on top level considerations and ensure alignment, while leaving a lot of freeway to the people in charge of executing.\n  D. Sull \u0026amp; K.M. Eisenhardt (\u0026nbsp; [Sull15] \u0026nbsp;) have rightly pointed out that if an organization’s strategy lives on the shelf then this organization has a problem. How to bridge the gap between strategy and execution? According to them, by polishing simple statements that help making on-the-spot decisions and adapting to rapidly changing circumstances.\nIndeed, they argue that while a checklist or any other process adherence technique is usually well adapted in repetitive situation (e.g. safety control) to ensure the activities alignment with corporate objectives. Agreeing on a simple ’principle’ is more adequate in more dynamic environment however, where flexibility is important. Process operators can then decide the most appropriate action to cope with the principle, subject to the actual circumstances.\nIn A.C. Hax’s words (\u0026nbsp; [Hax01] \u0026nbsp;) the true purpose of the strategy statement is to capture and clearly articulate our intent. Strategy is a fundamental vehicle to communicate our sense of direction, both inside and outside the organization. It aims to give purpose and direction to an organization and end up with the proper implementation of a well-designed strategy.\n This simple idea of not trying to fix in advance every tiny detail was made famous by D. Eisenhower who claimed \u0026ldquo;No plan survive the first contact with the enemy\u0026rdquo;.\n Chip \u0026amp; Dan Heath (\u0026nbsp; [Heath07] \u0026nbsp;) hammer on the message. The planning process forces people to think through the right issues, however even if you may start off trying to fight your plan, the enemy gets a vote.\n In the 80’s the Army invented the concept of CI (Commander’s intend): a crisp, plain-talk statement, specifying the goal, the desired end-state. You can lose the ability to execute the original plan but you never lose the responsibility of executing the CI.\n The commander’s intend should phrase something like \u0026lsquo;if we do nothing else, we must : xxx\u0026rsquo; or something like \u0026lsquo;the single most important thing is: xx\u0026rsquo;.\nStrategy here must give a sense of direction \u0026ldquo;If organisations didn\u0026rsquo;t decide where they wanted to go, any direction and activity would be fine - Without objectives and plans, organisations would be adrift.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;) Why do we need Strategy? While the overall field of strategic management is rather well delineated, there is very little consensus on What is strategy.\n There are strongly differing opinions on most key issues - and disagreements among practitioners, researchers and theorists as to what is strategy - so deep that even a common definition of the term strategy is illusive (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  So even before trying to define WHAT strategy is (at that stage let’s consider that strategy conveys the idea of being successful ), let\u0026rsquo;s first wonder WHY do we need strategy at all\nThree major factors underpin strategy By and large, three major factors underpin the need for strategic management :\n Scarcity - without limitation (of resources, skills, demand, competence, time, …) there would be no competition, no struggle to succeed, to control and access knowhow, markets or supply chains. Without scarcity all players could be equally successful, without effort\n Uncertainty – firms are exposed to dynamic ecosystems (customers, suppliers, competitors, society, authorities). Things change, often unpredictably. Risk is also inherent to most strategic moves and success can never be taken for granted. In addition, when a player initiates a strategic move, the actual outcome usually also depends upon other players’ reaction, which is rarely easy to forecast. Conversely, existing or to-be competitors may also make anticipated moves, which usually trigger chain responses.\n Choice – firms have to make decisions about their long-term orientations. It is usually important to explore several options, probing each one carefully before making a choice. But it is even more important to do make a choice. A firm has no real strategy until it has crossed the Rubicon and made irreversible decisions: select their perimeter of activities (what to do and what not to do), their operating model (how to do it) while preparing their future (e.g. innovation), commit to and execute a course of action. \u0026ldquo;Focus and commits a significant portion of its resources to the expected outcomes\u0026rdquo;. - (\u0026nbsp; [Andrews87] \u0026nbsp;)     A situation where no limitation can be spotted, everything seems deterministically planned and no specific decision is expected, should be considered with care. It may be the sign that either it does not fall within the scope of strategic management or it requires some serious reassessment.\n A real strategy involves a clear set of choices that define what the firm is going to do and what it’s not going to do. Many strategies fail to get implemented, despite the ample efforts of hard-working people, because they do not represent a set of clear choices.\n Many so-called strategies are in fact goals. We want to be the number one or number two in all the markets in which we operate is one of those. It does not tell you what you are going to do; all it does is tell you what you hope the outcome will be. But you’ll still need a strategy to achieve it. ( [Vermeulen] )\n The 5P for Strategy In a seminal work, Henry Mintzberg (\u0026nbsp; [Mintzberg87] [Mintzberg98] [Mintzberg05] \u0026nbsp;) stresses that the word strategy is being used in five different ways, in the field of strategic management, even if it is traditionally defined formally only in one.\n  Strategy as a Plan\n Considered as a plan, strategy is some sort of consciously intended course of action, a guideline (or set of guidelines) to deal with a situation. By this definition, plans have two essential characteristics : they are made in advance of the actions to which they apply and are developed purposefully.\n As a plan, a strategy is formulated through a conscious process and can be stated explicitly and formally. To Drucker (\u0026nbsp; [Druker85] \u0026nbsp;) strategy is purposeful action.\nIn Game Theory (\u0026nbsp; [VNM44] [Polak07] [Dixit15] [Aumann92] \u0026nbsp;) Strategy is as well a complete algorithm for playing the game. A Strategy tells a player what to do for every possible situation throughout the game.\n Plans enable commitment to a course of actions and coordinate all initiatives into a single cohesive pattern. Plans also facilitate optimal resource allocation and are good means of programming activities in advance. (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  Strategy as a Ploy\n\u0026lsquo;Strategy\u0026rsquo; can as well correspond to a specific maneuver intended to outwit an opponent. A firm may for instance pretend to establish a new practice area to discourage a competitor to do so. Here the real strategy (the real intention) is to prevent the move from the competitors and not the new practice area itself.\n Getting the better of competitors, by plotting to disrupt, dissuade, discourage, or otherwise influence them, can be part of a strategy.\n  Strategy a Pattern \n A strategy will be considered to have formed when as sequence of decisions exhibit some consistency over time. While strategy as a plan and/or a ploy are always indented, strategy as a pattern is not necessarily planned neither foreseen in advance.\n Strategy as a pattern – i.e. a stream of actions, consistency in behavior – can be compared to periods of great artists (i.e. their decisions about their work), where certain consistencies in their use of colors, forms, etc. can be observed (e.g. Picasso’s blue period). Strategy, in that case, corresponds to a posteriori consistencies in decisional behavior (whether intended or not).\nAs stressed by the Open University (\u0026nbsp; [OpenU] \u0026nbsp;) \u0026ldquo; every time a journalist imputes a strategy to a corporation or to a government, and every time a manager does the same thing to a competitor or even to the senior management of his own firm, they are implicitly defining strategy as pattern in action– that is, inferring consistency in behavior and labelling it strategy. They may, of course, go further and impute intention to that consistency – that is, assume there is a plan behind the pattern. But that is an assumption, which may prove false@rdquo;.\n  Strategy formulation is the conscious process through which an intended strategy is articulated.\nHowever, a strategy may also form gradually perhaps unintentionally, as decisions are made one by one.\nIn other words, strategies are not always deliberately planned. Strategy can be intended (a pattern of decision that formulate a course of action beforehand) or realized (a pattern of actions which forms without being explicitly formulated).\nStrategy a Position\nStrategy can consist in a position, i.e. a match (sometime mismatched) between the internal organization and its external environment.\n\u0026ldquo;Position is a static concept. At a given moment in time, is the firm competing on the basis of low costs or because it is differentiated in key dimensions\u0026rdquo;. (\u0026nbsp; [Besanko13] \u0026nbsp;)  In management terms, strategy becomes a product-market domain where resources are concentrated. Strategy as a position is what a firm do or don\u0026rsquo;t do (which is different from the plan, i.e. the course of actions to achieve it). A position can be preselected and aspired to through a plan (or ploy) and/or it can be reached, perhaps even found, through a pattern of behavior.\n In economic terms a position generates a rent (returns for being in a unique place). \u0026ldquo;Strategy is creating situations for economic rents and finding ways to sustain them\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [Rumelt82] \u0026nbsp;) Strategy as position must not be limited to ’two-person games’ (head-on competition), or even n-person situations. Strategy as position applies to any viable position, whether or not directly competitive.\nStrategy as Perspective\n Strategy can be a perspective, its content consisting not just of a chosen position, but also of an ingrained way of perceiving the world that usually echo the deepest firm’s beliefs and values. Some organizations are aggressive pacesetters, creating new technologies and exploiting new markets, other perceive the world as set and stable, sit back in long established markets and build protective shells around themselves, relying more on political influence than economic efficiency. There are organizations that favor marketing and build a whole ideology around that (e.g. IBM) others treat engineering in this way (e.g. Hewlett Packard) and then there are those that concentrate on sheer productive efficiency (e.g. MacDonald’s).\n   The above example, borrowed from (\u0026nbsp; [Mintzberg98] \u0026nbsp;) illustrates the difference and complementarity between strategy as a position and strategy as a perspective. McDonalds can focus on hamburger for lunch and diner or diversify into sandwitches for breakfast (they did in the late 90’s). However, McDonalds can continue to see itself as a fast food and value speed or want to conceive itself as a more sophisticated restaurant (with tablecloth / candles / china and silver cutlery).\n"

	"content": " A Firm transforms inputs into outputs Any firm, whether it produces products or services, transforms some inputs into outputs. Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables. Firms acquire the inputs from their suppliers in upstream markets and deliver their products or services to their direct customers in downstream markets.\nCapital Equipment: the transformation process may also require items (e.g. machinery, intellectual property) that are not transformed in the process and can be used repeatedly.\nFor B2C (Business to Consumers), customers are the final consumers of the products, whereas B2B (Business to Business firms deliver their products to other firms.\nWe start with an over-simplified case where there is a single supplier providing the goods, a single firm and a single customer acquiring the product. The actual price at which the product is sold and the actual price received by the supplier for the goods result from the bargaining between the customer and the firm on the one hand and between the firm and the supplier on the other. However two pivotal concepts, the willingess to pay and the willingness to sell.\nfig\nNote:In the remaining of the text, the word product will be used for any firm\u0026rsquo;s output (i.e. for both products and services.)\nWillingness to Pay The Willingness-to-Pay is the maximum price a customer is ready to pay to acquire a given good. It corresponds to what economists name usefulness, economic satisfaction or utility. This is the amount for which the customer is (theoretically) indifferent between keeping her/his money or obtaining the good. At a higher price, the customer would rather keep the money (which is worth more than the good’s utility for that customer). If offered at a price which s strictly inferior to the willingness to pay, then the customer can consider a commercial transaction. The difference between the transaction price and the perceived value is named customer’s surplus. If customers are rational, the surplus must always be positive.\n In economy, utility doesn’t convey any ethical, moral, religious or political connotation but only reflects preferences from economic agents. V. Pareto proposed to use the word ophelimity instead of utility. Likewise Irving Fisher suggested wantability, however utility was already too well established in economics literature.\n fig\nUsually Willingness to Pay cannot be easily measured. Brandburger \u0026amp; Harborne (\u0026nbsp; [Brandbuger96b] \u0026nbsp;) suggest the following thought experience to better capture the concept:\n if a rational customer is offered a product for free, he should be better off with that product than without it (economists call that the non-satiation axiom).\n from that situation, start to take money away from the customer (i.e. ask him to pay). When the amount of monety taken away is small, the customer should still prefer the situation with the product compared to the situation without the product.\n however as more money is taken away, there should be a moment when the customer prefers to keep his money and give the product back.\n the willingness to pay corresponds to the amount where the customer gauges that the situation with the product (less money) and without the product (with money) are equivalent.\n  Opportunity Cost The situation from the supplier\u0026rsquo;s perspective is symmetrical: the Willingness-to-sell (aka willingness-to-accept, reservation price) is the amount for which the supplier is indifferent between selling or not selling. A supplier would accept any price higher than the willingness to sell, but would reject any lower offer.\nfig\nThe willingness-to-pay is also known as the opportunity cost of selling, that is the value which is given up when the good is sold. The opportunity cost is the cost (loss of potential gain)incurred by not enjoying the value (utility) associated with the best alternative to selling the good.\n The employment of resource services in any manner involves a cost to the resource owners. This cost consists in their own evaluation of forgone alternatives, an evaluation made at the moment of commitment. J. Buchanan.\n Ross Gittins (\u0026nbsp; [Gittins] \u0026nbsp;) the Economics Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, stresses that the concept of Opportunity Cost while foundational to microeconomics can be misleading and even economists can get it wrong.\n The opportunity cost of a decision is the value (utility) of the next-best alternative. Imagine you win a free ticket (that cannot be resold) to see an Eric Clapton. On that same day, there is a Bod Dylan concert priced $40, knowing that you would usually be ready to pay $50 to see Dylan in concert. Going to Dylan\u0026rsquo;s concert is your best alternative to Clapton\u0026rsquo;s concert. What is the opportunity cost of going to Clapton\u0026rsquo;s concert ? $10 as you are forgoing $50 utility net from $40 costs.\n NoteAs stressed by Brandburger \u0026amp; Harborne, there must be well defined prices elsewhere in the economy (i.e. outside the modeled vertical chain) to allow the assessment of the willingness to pay and willingness to sell.\nValue Creation and Appropriation The value created by the vertical chain is the difference between customer\u0026rsquo;s willingness to pay and supplier\u0026rsquo;s opportunity cost.\nfig.\nBargaining between the players determine the how much vaue each player can capture and appropriate.\nPrice, consumer surplus, supplier surplus\n"

	"content": " As we will see later, a value proposition is at the interface between the firm and its customers, it is characterized by a mix of attributes (e.g. price, availability, reliability, technical specifications, image, ease of use, etc\u0026hellip;). For a transaction to take place the value proposition of a firm must be valued by a customer (willingness to pay) at a level that exceeds the price requested by the firm.\nAs stated by Peter Drucker: The only valid definition of a business purpose is to create a customer. However, for a business to be sustainable, it must also be profitable and generate some profit. Any firm must design value propositions that meet demand, but it must also adopt a value architecture so that it can generate earnings to reward its owners and debt-holders.\nFurthermore, as stressed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  firms may also seek to combine economic, social and environmental benefits. With strategic management concepts such as Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR), Ethics and Compliance (E\u0026amp;C) and eco-efficiency, firms address more globally their responsibilities toward their environment and stakeholders.\nCustomer Value The actual price at which a product is sold results from the bargaining between the customer and the firm (or from market forces). However only transactions for which the price is lower than WTP can occur.\nWillingness to Pay The Willingness-to-Pay is the maximum price a customer is ready to pay to acquire a given good. It corresponds to what economists name usefulness, economic satisfaction. This is the amount for which the customer is (theoretically) indifferent between keeping her/his money or obtaining the good. At a higher price, the customer would rather keep the money (which is worth more than the good’s utility for that customer). If offered at a price which is strictly inferior to the willingness to pay, then the customer can consider a commercial transaction. The difference between the transaction price and the perceived value is named customer’s surplus. If customers are rational, the surplus must always be positive.\n This notion is closed to the concept of utility defined in economy, where utility doesn’t convey any ethical, moral, religious or political connotation but only reflects preferences from economic agents. V. Pareto proposed to use the word ophelimity instead of utility. Likewise Irving Fisher suggested wantability, however utility was already too well established in economics literature.\n   Usually, Willingness to Pay cannot be easily measured. Brandburger \u0026amp; Harborne (\u0026nbsp; [Brandbuger96b] \u0026nbsp;) suggest the following thought experience to better capture the concept:\n if a rational customer is offered a product for free, she should be better off with that product than without it (economists call that the non-satiation axiom).\n from that situation, start to take money away from the customer (i.e. ask him to pay). When the amount of money taken away is small, the customer should still prefer the situation with the product compared to the situation without the product.\n however as more money is taken away, there should be a moment when the customer prefers to keep her money and give the product back.\n willingness to pay corresponds to the amount of money where the customer gauges that the situation with the product (less money) and without the product (with money) are equivalent.\n  The difference between the transaction price and the perceived value is named customer’s surplus.\n  Rational customers only transact so that they receive a positive surplus.\nValue attributes Human needs are infinite and insatiable. Psychologists define a need as a gap that triggers some action. Several classification of human needs have been established (e.g. Maslow’s pyramid which identifies the need for security, membership, self-esteem, \u0026hellip;).\nFor Customers, Value  yields from the perceived ability of a good or service to satisfy a need, that can be practical, demonstrative or any combination of the two.\n   By and large there are only two fundamental types of needs:\n functional needs (including basic needs: breathing, feeding, breeding)\n social needs (which may be contradictory: resemble others, assimilate to the group but at the same type differentiate oneself from the crowd, be recognized as individuals).\n    A product or service always aims at satisfying a need. However most needs combine basic needs (functional need) with social needs and are met by socially significant forms (to have dinner at a fancy restaurant vs. eating).\nThe value of a proposition must always be considered from the perspective of the customer(s). Value derives from utilitarian aspects but also from more peripheral elements related to the context of consumption, use and/or purchase which represent more subjective but nevertheless real and often substantive sources of satisfaction.\nValue can for instance be attributed - see (\u0026nbsp; [Aurier] \u0026nbsp;) for a more detailed ontology - to the functional aspects (performance in terms of tangible, concrete rendered service), knowledge acquisition (education, cultural products, museum), emotional stimulation (entertainment, personal experience), self expression and establishment of a social bond.\n  Products \u0026amp; services therefore always encompass, to some extend, consuming signs (willingness to display a status, need for control, need for security). A value proposition has therefore two dimensions: a practical / functional dimension and a demonstrative / social dimension.\nConsumption Context can also Matter Value Proposition attributes are not limited to the functional \u0026amp; social aspects of the product or the service. Indeed, sometimes the context in which the product/service is consumed also significantly matters.\n  Dawar (\u0026nbsp; [Dawar03] \u0026nbsp;) stresses that on a hot day, consumers are ready to pay 7-fold more for a cold soda. The perceived value of the product is therefore influenced by the circumstances.\nDawar goes on step further an claims that the way the product is channeled to customers (the place in mix-marketing terms) can also seriously affect the perceived value.\n  Customers don\u0026rsquo;t always know in advance what they (might) value While Marketing has grown the concept of focus groups (where people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, or service) many innovators considers that consumers are not always capable of anticipating their needs.\n  You can\u0026rsquo;t usually directly access a customer\u0026rsquo;s Willingness To Pay - and it must therefore be appraised indirectly.\nShareholder value The term Shareholder Value (paying dividends and raising the stock price) became popular in the 80\u0026rsquo;s when big companies put increasing their shareholders\u0026rsquo; wealth at the forefront of their business goals, to attract new investors and capital.\nShareholder value is the value delivered to the equity owners of a corporation due to management\u0026rsquo;s ability to increase sales, earnings, and free cash flow, which leads to an increase in dividends and capital gains for the shareholders. Value. Investopedia\n According to Paul Barnett, it is Milton Friedman (one of the most influential economist, from the Chicago School, who received the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 1976) who imposed maximizing shareholder value as the sole purpose of a firm. This is now being challenged by academics, practitioners and society at large.\nWhat is Profit ? Some general managers tend to believe that maximizing revenue growth and maximizing profit would be the holy grail of management. However, they are making a major flaw in ignoring the level of investment that was required to obtain that profit.\nA firm must create value and capture some. More precisely it must capture value in excess of the opportunity costs of its financing. Generating profit is not good enough. Profit must be considered in comparison to the level of capital (equity and debts) it requires to get generated. Profit must be compared to the level of investment that was required. This section explores various ratios used to evaluate the return.\nIncome Statement\nThe income statement (also called the Profit and Lost or P\u0026amp;L statement) reports revenues and expenses for a fiscal period.\n  The Income Statement represents flows that is the summary of what happened during a period (quarter, year).\n  Key indicators can be derived from the P\u0026amp;L:\n The Gross Margin is obtained by subtracting \u0026lsquo;cost of good sold\u0026rsquo; from \u0026lsquo;revenue\u0026rsquo;. The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS also called Cost of Sales) corresponds to expenses directly attached to producing the product or delivering the service (e.g. Raw material, direct Wages and salaries, Packaging, Energy \u0026amp; consumables for the machinery, \u0026hellip;).\n The EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is obtained by subtracting SG\u0026amp;A (Marketing \u0026amp; Sales, Administration, R\u0026amp;D – sometimes called overhead or non-productive costs)costs and one-off costs (if any) from the gross margin. The EBITDA reflects both direct and indirect costs and is a cash flow item (the sum of cash actually received or spent).\n The Operating Profit or EBIT is obtained by subtracting Depreciation and Amortization from EBITDA. Depreciation and Amortization refer to the decrease in value of assets that are used during several periods (e.g. plants, buildings, machinery, \u0026hellip;). DA doesn’t correspond to any actual payment (payment took place in the past when the asset was acquired). Therefore the EBIT is not a cash item.\n  For the purpose of preparing an Income Statement, revenues and expenses are not accounted exactly when money transfer occurs: i) Sales are accounted when the product or service is delivered – the actual payment will usually happen later and ii) Expenses are as well accounted when the product is delivered. The P\u0026amp;L doesn’t reflect all the events that altered the financial position (equity increase, bond issue, inventory, etc).\nNote: Strictly speaking EBIT and operating profit are two different things in the sense that EBIT may encompass non-operating income as well. However, more often than not, EBIT and opera- ting profit are considered equivalent.\n Sharing earnings \nThe operating profit – which can be seen as the result of operating the business – cannot be kept entirely by the firm. Indeed several stakeholders claim their share of the pie.\n  What remains (positive or negative number) once interests and taxes have been paid, is named the net income (aka Earnings After Taxes). A part can be paid to the shareholders as dividend and the remaining (retained earnings) is kept by the company (adds up to the equity part in the balance sheet).\nCost of Capital The various stakeholders form expectations about the return they might receive from the firm.\n  Taxes\nTax authorities are relatively clear about what they expect. The word ’clear’ is arguably not suitable here as tax laws can be very complex and obscure. However taxes are due and are rather deterministic. Taxes are usually computed from the EBIT (i.e. there are no taxes on operating losses).\nDebts\nIn exchange for the money that they lend, debt holders expect to receive compensation (typically an interest rate). From the perspective of the firm this is called the cost of debt.\n Shareholders\nShareholders also expect a return from their investment. However (and unlike tax authorities and debt holders) shareholders bear more risks and are associated to the fate of the business.\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is one of the most famous theoretical model that assess the appropriate rate of return of an asset. By and large it considers that the expected return for any business should be the risk-free return (typically treasury bond) to which a premium is added, subject to the level of risk of the business.\n  Weighted Average Cost of Capital Excluding current liabilities, a firm receives its capital from its shareholders who own the equity (E) and debt holders who own Long-term debts (D).\n  Shareholders expect \\( K_e \\) in return for their investment, which for the firm, corresponds to a total cost of equity of \\( Ke.E \\). Likewise, debt holders expect \\( K_d \\), which for the firm, corresponds to a total cost of debt of \\( Kd.D \\). The total cost of raising \\( E + D \\) is therefore \\( Ke.E + Kd.D \\). The average cost, named the WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital), of raising one unit (i.e. one euro, one dollar, etc\u0026hellip;) is therefore: \\( \\frac{Ke.E+Kd.D}{E+D} \\)\n"

	"content": " There are many definitions of the concept of Business Model.\nIn a nutshell, a BM is a simplified representation of a business that stresses both the intent and inner logic (\u0026nbsp; [Osterwalder10] \u0026nbsp;) .\n  A Business Model  is „the set of mechanisms by which a company can create value through the value proposition made to its customers, its value architecture and capture that value to turn it into profits” [Lehmann-Ortega].\n \u0026nbsp;\nCommunication and Self-Reflexion tool The Business Model concept has become common place in many industries and is proving valuable as both a communication and self-reflexion tool. It has also spread to strategic practices as a means of in depth checking of a strategic design.\nThe stakes are as much in the coherence, consistency of the strategic vision and enterprise architecture as in the ability to mobilize and convince the various stakeholders and materialize the vision.\n This becomes even more crucial in a context where „economic instability became the rule and therefore requires the company to demonstrate constant agility in order to adapt and even create innovative solutions to ensure its development” (\u0026nbsp; [Vilain11] \u0026nbsp;) .\n As stressed by Grandval and Ronteau, the BM concept can be leveraged by strategists, to regain the freedom to formulate a strategic intention and guide the strategic action (in the original and military sense of the word strategy ). It can as well assist the management team in identifying and organizing the company efficiently and effectively through continuous business innovation. Rethinking and improving a company’s strategy often starts with establishing a genuine model of its current businesses.\nFurthermore, a Business Model can be viewed as a didactic description of the strategic vision and its implementation. It help managers and entrepreneurs build narrative or stories in a coherent manner and allows for effective communication with the company’s stakeholders (customers, employees, partners, suppliers, investors). It is a valuable tool to get the different stakeholders involved and supportive\nA Business model answer Peter Drucker\u0026rsquo;s questions As underpinned by Joan Magretta (ibidem), Business Models are stories that answer Perter Drucker’s old age questions :\n Who is the customer ? Who is being satisfied ?\n What do customers value ? What are the needs, what is being satisfied ?\n How are customers being satisfied ? What are the distinctive capabilities ?\n How do we capture part of the created value (i.e. make profit ) ? What is the underlying economic logic ?\n  Several different business conceptualizations have been proposed. Despite differences they all aim at building formal descriptions of business architectures from a set of building blocks.\nTwo well established models will be used instead: Odyssey 3.14 (\u0026nbsp; [Lehmann-Ortega15] \u0026nbsp;) and the Business Model Canvas (\u0026nbsp; [Osterwalder10] \u0026nbsp;) .\nThe Odyssey Model Odyssey, the simplest of the two models, emphasizes the three major aspects of any venture : WHAT is offered, HOW is it produced and can it be PROFITABLE?\n  The model was designed by two professors at HEC and many students are likely to get exposed to it. The model is documented in a book and MOOCs are available as well. The model hinges upon three major components or pillars as the authors call them:\n Value Proposition - the front-office aspects of any business: i) Who are the (possibly segmented) customers? ii) What products and services are offered? and iii) What pricing policy is associated to the various products and customers?\n Value Architecture - how to deliver the value proposition: i) What are the required activities ? ii) What resources \u0026amp; competences are needed and are controlled by the firm ? iii) What is performed within the firm as opposed to outsourced to somebody else ?\n Profit Equation - the quantitative summary of the whole: i) What are the revenues streams ? ii) What are the associated costs ? iii) What investments are required ?\n  The Business Model Canvas The business Model Canvas follows the same logic, but offers further refinements, by being more specific about the Value Proposition (including customer experience and interaction) and the Value architecture (including resources \u0026amp; competences and partnering).\nBeing very visual, the model (initially derived from A. Osterwalder’s academic work) is perfectly suited for group work for developing and documenting business models.\n  Compared to the Odyssey model, the BM Canvas is more detailed (i.e. top level components are further broken down into smaller constituents). However the very same rationale applies here as well.\n Customers - two aspects are key with delineating targeted customers: i) Customer Segments a company must identify which customers it tries to serve. Customers can be segmented into various subsets, according to their specific needs and attributes. Typical market attributes encompass the size (e.g. mass market vs niche market) and whether it corresponds to personal or professional consumption.\nii) some companies will serve mutually dependent customer segments. A credit card company will provide services to both credit card holders while simultaneously assisting merchants who accept those credit cards. The ability to recognize a multi-sided platform is pivotal to many business models Indeed, one type of customers only (e.g. advertisers) can generate revenues, while the most obvious value proposition is targeted at another category of customers.\n Value Proposition - The collection of products and services a company offers to meet the needs of its customers. The value proposition can encompass various elements such as newness, performance, ’one stop shop- ping’, customization, ’getting the job done’, design, notoriety/brand/status, price, cost reduction, risk reduction, accessibility, and convenience/usability.\n Channels - how a company reaches and engages its customer segments to deliver a Value Proposition. Channels are customer touch points that play a crucial role in the customer experience: raising awareness of the Value Proposition, evaluating the proposition relatively to alternatives, purchasing \u0026amp; ordering, receiving (delivery, shipment, \u0026hellip;) the product or service and last but not least obtaining post-purchase support. A company can deliver its value proposition to its targeted customers through different channels: either through its own channels (store front, web site), partner channels (major distributors), or a combination of both. Effective channels will distribute a company’s value proposition in ways that are fast, efficient and cost effective.\n Customer Relationship - this building block corresponds to the ways a firm wants to establish contact with a customer (mechanisms, timing, frequency, etc) for the purpose of customer acquisition, customer retention, up-selling and sales boost, etc. Customer loyalty is paramount to ensure the survival and success of any business. Companies must identify the type of relationship they want to create with their customer segments, which may include:\ni) personal assistance during sales and/or after sales, ii) dedicated personal assistance a sales representative is assigned to handle all the needs and questions of a special set of customers, iii) self service the company provides the tools needed for the customers to serve themselves easily and effectively (typical of web-based business),\niv) automated service similar to self-service but more personalized as it has the ability to identify individual customers and his/her preferences. An example of this would be Amazon.com making book suggestions based on the characteristics of previous purchases, v) communities allows for a direct interaction among different clients, vi) co-creation the customer’s direct input is included in to the final company’s products/services (wikipedia is an example of co-created product).\n     Key Activities - underlines the most important activities (whether performed by the company or not) that are required to deliver the company’s value proposition.\n Key Resources - (human, financial, physical and/or intellectual) necessary to carry out activities. Those activities for which the firm owns appropriate resources are usually performed in-house (\u0026lsquo;make\u0026rsquo; part). By contrast, the firm can choose to transfer some activities to external partners (\u0026lsquo;buy\u0026rsquo; part).\n Partner Network - most companies rely on buyer-supplier relationships so they can focus on their core activity. Partnership, here also covers complementary business alliances (e.g. joint ventures, strategic alliances) between competitors or non-competitors. In case of ’multisided markets’, some Customers can easily get confused with Partners. For an external stakeholder to be a partner, the firm must transform the inputs it receives. For instance, content providers (movies, music albums, books) are more customers to i-tunes rather than suppliers/partners.\n     Profit - results from the difference between revenues and costs. The Business Model Canvas articulates the two sides of the equation and offer the opportunity to visually see how to increase revenues and/or reduce costs.\ni) Cost Structure Characteristics it is essential to clearly identify Fixed Costs (including sunk costs) from variable costs. ii) Revenue Streams the company must identify all the sources of its incomes and understand how each customer segment contributes to revenue generation.\n Even customers who are not responsible for any direct payment can contribute to generate revenues from other customer groups (e.g. network effect aka customer side economies of scale).\n  Relationships \u0026amp; channels Osterwalder (\u0026nbsp; [Osterwalder10] \u0026nbsp;) stresses that there are different categories of customer groups, each leading to specific Customer Relationships and Distribution Channels:\n Mass market - Business that focus on mass markets don’t seek to distinguish between customers. The Value Proposition as well as Distribution Channels and Customer Relationships target a large group of customers with very similar needs and expectations. There is very little customization if any.\n Niche market - Along side large groups of customers, there might exist smaller groups with very distinct needs. Tailoring the Value Proposition, Distribution Channels and Relationships to one of this smaller groups can allow very successful business models.\n Segmented market - Some firms would rather deal with more than one customer group (either mass market or niche market). Serving several customer segments often imply establishing several distinct value propositions but also dedicated distribution channels and distinguished customer relationships.\n Diversified market - Firm can also decide to address unrelated customer groups (serve very different needs). When Amazon.com launched AWS they star- ted a different business and faced diversified (possibly segmented) customer groups. Offering diversified Value Propositions usually requires implementing different Value Architectures.\n Multi-sided market - Firms can serve several interdependent customer groups. Unlike segmented or diversified business models, a multi-sided business model relies on the two (or more) sides and requires the adhesion of the two sides to be successful.\n    Customer Value Creation A mix of several attributes both quantitative (price, speed of service) or qualitative (novelty, design) contribute to customer value creation, including :\n Newness - A Value Proposition can satisfy an entirely new set of needs, often that customers didn’t perceive previously. Such VP can rely on new technologies (e.g. smartphone), new social habits (e.g. shared economy) or personal aspiration (e.g. ethical funds).\n Performance - The offering is comparable in essence to the pre-existing reference point but deliver more performance (e.g. computer disk space, processor power, display resolution). In a very mature market, performance only is unlikely to yield any significant market growth.\n Customization - Sometimes called customer co-creation, allows a large range of customization (e.g. color, shape, etc\u0026hellip;) while still benefiting from standardization and economies of scale.\n Getting the job done - Start from recognizing customer hassle and help reduce the pain.\n Design - a product may stand out because of superior design and for aesthetic reasons.\n Brand / Status - the perceived value is not necessarily purely functional (derived from using the product). Sometimes owning / wearing the pro- duct can be a social signal that conceals value in itself\n Risk reduction - a value proposition may encompass elements to reduce the risks incurred by a customer (e.g. guarantee, fixed-fees, service-level agreement)\n Accessibility - innovations and/or new technologies can make product/service available to new customers. For the business model innovator this is a way to address previously untapped markets.\n  Classical Business models This section briefly explores six very common and famous business model patterns (\u0026nbsp; [Osterwalder10] \u0026nbsp;) . Patterns must be seen as general, re-usable archetypes or architectural design ideas that can inspire new business models. This is a non-exhaustive list and other patterns could be considered as well.\n  Most real life business cases are often a mix of several patterns. Understanding the patterns helps unveil the characteristics, building blocks and profit equation logic of real businesses.\nIt can also support business innovation in suggesting how an existing business model might evolve. It is key however to identify under which conditions a given business model pattern is effective. Otherwise patterns could be inappropriately applied.\nBundling / Unbundling Unbundling is the process of breaking apart the various components of a product of service. Conversely bundling consists in grouping several items into a single Value Proposition.\n  Unbundling allow for low-end differentiation: a lower price is offered as less features are included into the product/service. Low cost airlines are canonical examples of unbundling (additional services such as carry-on / check luggage, seat booking, extra leg room, printed ticket, on board refreshment, \u0026hellip;, are billed on top of the fare).\nMore recently and in the context of the Internet, unbundling usually also suggests the dematerialization and supply of contents at scale and cost unmatchable by former physical suppliers (e.g. MOOC vs in-class courses).\n  In the context of corporate strategy and mergers \u0026amp; acquisitions, unbundling can mean that a company with several lines of business is split and sold off in parts.\n  Competition Authorities (e.g. EU) are usually very keen to foster unbundling and limit market power \u0026amp; monopolistic situations. In Europe, the deregulation in the areas of Telecommunications, Railway Transport and Energy came with unbundling measures (e.g. separation of transport network and services to subscriber, separation of railway infrastructure and trains, separation of energy production and energy distribution).\nPay per X Many business models still rely on cash-for-product: the revenue stream is associated with the transfer of ownership of a tangible product.\nHowever there are many more ways to receive payment and innovative business models can be designed by offering different billing schemes.\n  In pay-per-view or pay-per-use models the transfer of ownership of physical goods (e.g. purchasing a DVD) is replaced by a right-to-use service (e.g. watching a film). This scheme has been used by many brick-and-mortar businesses (e.g. Cinema, Hotel, Public Transport) and is becoming even more trendy with the Internet (car-pooling, cloud computing, etc\u0026hellip;).\nSubscription models are a form of pay-per-use services where nearly unlimited consumption is allowed for a certain period of time (e.g. Netflix, Safari on-line, Kindle). For instance, in the anticafé you don’t pay for what you drink or eat but for how long you stay.\nWith Power by the hour services, an OEM (car manufacturer, aircraft manufacturer, etc) takes responsibility for the maintenance, repair and overhaul for a flat-fee loan.\nLong Tail Although the phenomenon is well known from statisticians, the term long tail was first coined in business by Chris Anderson in 2004 in Wired Magazine and extended later in a book (\u0026nbsp; [Anderson06] \u0026nbsp;) .\n  The main idea is that items in very low demand can still collectively make a significant market, provided that the costs of supply remain marginal (distribution, inventory, sourcing, \u0026hellip;).\nThe model can barely be implemented by brick-and-mortar stores because the demand they are facing is not sufficient. By contrast, internet distribution allow players to address very large audience of potential customers which makes the model economically viable.\nIn the Wired Magazine Blog Josh Petersen, a former Microsoft and Amazon executive, described the long tail as \u0026ldquo;We sold more books today that didn’t sell at all yesterday than we sold today of all the books that did sell yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\nMulti-sided \u0026ldquo;Multi-sided Platforms bring together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers. Such platforms are of value to one group of customers only if the other groups of customers are also present. The platform creates value by facilitating interactions between the different groups. A multi-sided platform grows in value to the extent that it attracts more users, a phenomenon known as the Network Effect. Network effects and Positive feedback loops are economic terms that describe the snowballing benefits to front-runners in some markets.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [Ankaraju10] \u0026nbsp;) .\n  Multi-sided platforms (including two-sided) are not specific to Internet Businesses and have long existed before (e.g. credit card network, classified ad publications, etc\u0026hellip;). The term platform refers here to the organization that enables interactions between the distinct types of affiliated customers.\nNevertheless Internet Businesses are leveraging Multi-sided businesses like never before, as it allows for further segmentation/customization.\n  For multi-sided business models, it is paramount to identify the various types of customers and delineate their core interest/benefits. Then it is even more important to ensure that some of the total value created can be captured by the platform.\nFreemium Freemium is defined by wikipedia as ”a pricing strategy by which a product or service is provided free of charge”.\nFreemium is extensively used by the software industry where pieces of soft- ware can be used free of charge (shareware) or the source code is made available for anyone to read, inspect or modify (open source). According to E. Seufert (\u0026nbsp; [Seufert14] \u0026nbsp;) one of the main reasons for deploying a Freemium business model is to quickly and efficiently acquire a large customer base through word of mouth, referral networks, social network, etc\u0026hellip; and therefore enjoy significant demand economies of scale (network effect).\nA freemium model is particularly suitable when the marginal cost of producing extra units is low. A freemium business model can be coupled with a multi-sided platform model, where revenues are captured from one type of affiliated customers only (e.g. advertisers). Likewise, a freemium business model can be associated with tiered services, where some extra features, capacity, services (e.g. support, training, configuration) are chargeable.\n  For instance, most cloud service providers – ranging from Infrastructure providers (IaaS), platform providers (PaaS) to software service providers (SaaS) – use freemium pattern in their business models.\nOther examples include free-to-play games where games can be downloaded for free. Revenues are generated by in-game items that can be purchased by players to enhance game-play and/or aesthetics. For instance Thinkgaming.com estimates that in Nov 2016 the total revenue generated by Pokemon Go is nearly USD 5million, of which 10% from advertising and 90% from In-Application Purchases. In Jul 2018, Sensor Tower estimates total revenue for Pokemon Go has surpassed $1.8 billion\nBait \u0026amp; Hook The Bait and Hook (aka Razor and Blade) business model was first introduced by Gillette: products (the razor in the case of Gillette) are sold at rather low price but require refills, consumables or additional products (the hook) that are sold at higher prices.\n  The model has been extensively used by companies who want to derive pro- fit from recurring purchases. For instance, Nespresso subsidizes the purchase of Nespresso machines but sell Nespresso capsules. Telecom operators may provide cell phones for free or nearly for free in exchange for a data plan over several months.\nOpen innovation Open innovation has been extensively studied by H. Chesbrough (\u0026nbsp; [Chesbrough03] [Chesbrough06] \u0026nbsp;) . In his own words\n ”Open innovation is a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as the firms look to advance their technology ”.\n   The main difference between closed and open innovation is that the later hinges upon widely distributed knowledge while the former rely on internal resources only. With the open innovation paradigm, a company can buy or operate inventions from third parties and likewise license or sell some of its own innovations. According to this model, knowledge and intellectual innovation is no longer concentrated in a few very large organizations. Smaller institutions or even individuals can find outlets for their work as companies look for ideas outside their boundaries.\nWith crown sourcing, (e.g. crown design) the model goes even beyond outsourcing innovation, in the sense that is creates a full eco-system where competing/collaborating organizations or people are bringing their insights and ideas.\nNetworks are often good for solving design and research problems because they can bring experts coming from different fields (including from outside of the firm’s industry). It is however important to define an adequate set of incentives to ensure that users from outside participate and that in-house experts don’t systematically get preference over experts from the crowd.\nBusiness sModel typology Considering the number of parameters that can influence a business, there are countless ways of clustering and depicting business models. However, the typology proposed (\u0026nbsp; [Malone06] \u0026nbsp;) is in many ways, illuminating as it first considers what asset rights are being sold by a firm, and then looks at what kind of assets are involved.\n  The following is a free adaptation of the framework original description.\nType of right sold The heart of any business is what it sells and offers to its customers. One of the most significant characteristic is the kind of legal right that is conferred to the buyer upon the completion of the transaction.\n Right of ownership - Buyers acquire the continuing right to use an asset (the ownership title is transferred to the customer) in any way, including selling, destroying, or disposing of it. It is usually useful to distinguish between firms that build what they sell (e.g. manufacturers) from those that sell what other firms have made (e.g. retailers).\n Right to use - Customers buy the right to use assets (e.g. rented car, hotel room, phone subscription, pay-tv) in a certain way for a given period of time, while the ownerships of the asset is not transferred.\n Right to Match - is the right to be matched with potential buyers or sellers of something. For instance a real estate broker first secures the right to buy, sell or lease a property on behalf of the principal and then can sell this right to a counter-party.\n   Categories of Firms Based on the type of right criterion, there are mainly four categories of firms. Obviously a firm may offer various value propositions based on different business models. In the remaining we assume a single, unbundled offer.\n Creator - designs a product, buys raw materials and inputs from upstream suppliers, then transforms or assembles – a creator can outsource the manufacturing of its product – them to create a ’product’ sold to buyers.\n Distributor - buys a product and resells essentially the same product to somebody else. The distributor may offer additional services like repackaging or transporting the product.\n Landlord - sells the right to use (i.e. to make temporally use of an asset) but not to own.\n Broker - facilitates sales by matching potential buyers and sellers. Unlike a distributor, a broker doesn\u0026rsquo;t take ownership of the product being sold. A Broker can receive a fee from the buyer, the seller or both.\n  Types of assets A business model is also characterized by the type of assets for which rights are being sold.\n Physical any durable items (building, computer, and machine tools) as well as nondurable items (food, clothing, paper),\n Intangible legally protected intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc..) as well as other intangible assets like knowledge, goodwill, brand,\n Financial cash and other assets like stocks, bonds, insurance policies that give their owners rights to potential future cash flows,\n Human people time and effort\n   Combination  In theory, each of the types of right can be associated with each of the types of assets which yields sixteen different business models. The list of business models and associated definitions are verbatim from [Malone et al., 2006].\n  Manufacturer creates and sells physical assets. Manufacturer is the predominant type of Creator. Examples: Airbus, General Motors.\nInventor creates and then sells intangible assets such as patents and copyrights. Firms using this business model exclusively are relatively rare, but some technology firms generate part of their revenues this way. Firms that license the use of their intangible assets while still retaining ownership are not classified as Inventors; they are Intellectual Landlords (see below).\nEntrepreneur creates and sells financial assets often creating and selling firms. We do not include in this business model entrepreneurs who never sell the firms they create.\nHuman Creator creates and sells human assets. Malone stressed that since selling human –whether they were created naturally or artificially or obtained by capture– is illegal and morally repugnant in most places today, this business model is included here for logical completeness and as a historical footnote about a form of business model that was more common in the past. However, the new development in AI and robotics may relaunch this business model by creating and selling robots.\nWholesaler/Retailer buys and sells physical assets. This is the most common type of Distributor. Examples : Wal*Mart, Amazon.\nIntellectual Property Trader buys and sells intangible assets. This business model includes firms that buy and sell intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, domain names, etc.\nFinancial Trader buys and sells financial assets without significantly transforming (or designing) them. Banks, investment firms, and other fi- nancial institutions that invest for their own account are included in this business model.\nHuman Distributor buys and sells human assets. Like Human Creators, this business model is illegal and rare in most places and is included here only for logical completeness.\nPhysical Landlord sells the right to use a physical asset. The asset may, for example, be a location (such as an amusement park) or equipment (such as construction equipment). Depending on the kind of asset, the payments by customers may be called ’rent’, ’lease’, ’admission’, or other similar terms. This business model is common in industries like real estate rental and leasing, accommodation, airlines and recreation.\nIntellectual Landlord licenses or otherwise gets paid for limited use of intangible assets. There are three major subtypes of Intellectual Landlord i) a publisher provides limited use of information assets such as software, newspapers, or databases in return for a purchase price or other fee (often called a subscription or license fee), ii) a Brand Manager gets paid for the use of a trademark, know-how, or other elements of a brand. This includes franchise fees for businesses such as restaurant or hotel chains and iii) an Attractor attracts people ?s attention using, for example, television programs or web content and then ?sells ? that attention (an intangible as- set) to advertisers. The Attractor may devote significant effort to creating or distributing the assets that attract attention, but the source of revenue is from the advertisers who pay to deliver a message to the audience that is attracted. This business model is common in radio and television broad- casting, some forms of publishing, and some Internet-based businesses. Example : New York Times, Google.\nFinancial Landlord lets others use cash (or other financial assets) under certain (often time-limited) conditions. There are two major subtypes i) Lenders provide cash that their customers can use for a limited time in return for a fee (usually called ’interest’) and ii) Insurers provide their customers financial reserves that the customers can use only if they experience losses. The fee for this service is usually called a ’premium’.\nContractor sells a service provided primarily by people, such as consulting, construction, education, personal care, package delivery, live entertainment or healthcare. Payment is fee for service, often (but not always) based on the amount of time the service requires. In most cases, Contractors also require physical assets (such as tools and workspace), and Physical Landlords also provide human services (such as cleaning hotel rooms and staffing amusement parts) associated with their physical assets. In cases where substantial (more than 50% in value) amounts of both human and physical assets are used to provide a service, we classify a firm\u0026rsquo;s business model (as Contractor or Physical Landlord) on the basis of which kind of asset is ’essential’ to the nature of the service being provided.\nFinancial broker matches buyers and sellers of financial assets. This includes insurance Brokers and stock Brokerage functions in many large financial firms.\nPhysical broker matches buyers and sellers of physical assets. Examples: eBay, Century 21.\nIntellectual property (IP) broker matches buyers and sellers of intangible assets.\nHuman Resources (HR) broker matches buyers and sellers of human services. Examples: interim agencies\n"

	"content": " PESTEL The PESTLE analysis is a tool to scan the external macro environment (big picture) in which a business operates or could operate. It aims at pinpointing which of the external factors have the biggest influence on the business (can be either positive stimulus or constraints). It is therefore important that the influence stemming from of the various factors are well understood.\nMoreover a PESTLE analysis aims at deciding which of the factors can change the rules of the game in the future. The future influence of the factors – which may differ from their past influence – must therefore be forecasted. If needed several future scenarios can be worked out.\n  It is also essential to clearly delineate the subject and scope of a PESTLE analysis (market, industry, customer segment, geography). If needed, several analyses, on different subjects/scopes, can be performed.\nThe six PESTEL dimensions (Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal) must be seen as a checklist. Likewise there are many lists of potential ’factors’ that can be used as guidelines. This doesn’t imply howe- ver that one factor from each and every dimension should be selected. What does matter, by contrast, is to spot the factors that have the biggest influence. In some situation all such factors may belong to a single dimension (e.g. only economical factors matter).\nFactor Map Facilitation techniques such as interviews, guided and/or unguided “brown paper”, questionnaires, etc can be used to brainstorm factors. When factors are identified, the implication or influence of each factor must be understood. Likewise, the time horizon at which the influence can become tangible and the probability that this occurs must be estimated.\nDuring interactive workshops, “influences” are often identified before “factors” (i.e. the consequences before the causes). This is not an issue and can even be used as a tactics for brainstorming. However, it is important to continue the analysis until the true factors (the causes) can be pointed out.\nDraw the big picture The first stage in understanding the environment is to delineate the industry or industries, which requires identifying the categories of players, their activities and relationships. It is preferable to start with simplistic models (accepting to remain vague and imprecise) rather than immediately trying to formalize value systems. The objective is not yet to perform an external analysis but rather to define the boundaries.\nIt is always a good idea to first widen the scope. Indeed many industries are converging (former distinct industries are now becoming a single industry). Furthermore, customers of an industry may consider alternative products or services offered by different industries. In that case, competition (and therefore opportunities and threats) extends beyond the boundaries of the currently accepted industry.\nDuring interactive workshops, “influences” are often identified before “factors” (i.e. the consequences before the causes). This is not an issue and can even be used as a tactics for brainstorming. However, it is important to continue the analysis until the true factors (the causes) can be pointed out.\n  Two criteria are usually considered for the down-selection of factors: their level of influence and their probability of likelihood.\n High probability / High influence These are the factors to consider in priority, as they are likely to occur (or even are already occurring) and have a significant influence upon the industry. For existing factors they probably contributed to shape the structure of the industry, as it exists today. For future factors they are probably identified by all the players and ranked as contributing to opportunities and/or threats. Influent players may even try to exercise control (individually or collectively) on some factors (e.g. lobbying, communication, etc).\n High probability / Low influence These are the factors that either already exists or are very likely to occur in the future. However, they have a secondary impact or influence on the industry (for instance they complement the influence of one of the pivot factors). Such factors can be ignored, however, it is important to reassess their influence either periodically or when the analysis has progressed.\n Low probability / Low influence Such factors are both unlikely and even if they occur they would have little influence on the environment. They can be largely ignored.\n Low probability / high influence Such factors, although unlikely would have high influence if they occur. At the extreme, these factors can correspond to what Nassim Taleb coined a “Black Swan” : events beyond the realm of normal expectations, hard to predict and with disproportionate high-impacts. Very often such factors are part of the collective beliefs of an industry, they are implicit, and their existence (or absence) are taken for granted. However when such a factor changes, the impact on the industry can be tremendous.\n  Scenarios For very global, long-term prospective analysis (e.g. Air Transport in 2050) it is extremely hazardous to estimate the probabilities of the various factors. In such a situation the few factors that are deemed to have the highest influence (e.g. fuel price, geopolitical stability, demand for transport) are considered in priority. Then the potential outcomes for each and every factor must be defined – usually only ”extreme” outcomes are kept (low fuel price, high fuel price, extremely high fuel price).\nThe various combinations of factors/possible outcomes correspond to a potential scenario. The objective here is not to predict but to encourage managers to be alerted to a range of possible futures.\nAlthough simple in its principles, this technique is extremely difficult to use in practice, due to its rapid combinatorial explosion. With too few factors, the analysis remains naive; with too many it quickly becomes unmanageable. In practice, analyses are limited to a very few factors (2 – 3 factors). The value lies in the process of exploration and contingency planning that the scenarios set off.\n  "

	"content": " Performance difference is not the rule in all industries and although differences may exist, they are often short lived. Nevertheless some firms, in many different industries, in many different countries and contexts, are doing better than others.\nCompetitive Advantage Understanding the conditions and factors that control over-performance, has taken center stage in business strategy.\n„An enterprise has a competitive advantage if it is able to create more economic value than the marginal (break-even) competitor in its product market, where economic value is the difference between the perceived benefits gained by the purchasers of the firm’s goods or services and the economic cost to the enterprise.” [Peteraf03]\n Competitive advantage is obtained when a firm develops or acquires a set of characteristics that allow it to outperform its competitors.\n Competitive advantage grows fundamentally out of value a firm is able to create for its buyers that exceeds the firm\u0026rsquo;s cost of creating it. Porter85\n \u0026nbsp;\n Competition is anyone who can influence a business\u0026rsquo; cost or revenues adversely. Puranam16\n According to Porter (\u0026nbsp; [Porter80] [Porter85] [Porter98] \u0026nbsp;) the choice of competitive Strategy is driven by two central questions (neither is sufficient by itself):\n the attractiveness of industries for the long-term profitability (and the factors that determine it)\n the determinants of relative competitive position within an industry.\n     To be successful, firms need to gain a competitive advantage over rival organisations operating in the same business areas. Within the competitive arena chosen by the firm, it needs to accrue enough power to counter balance the demands of buyers and suppliers, to outperform rival, to discourage new firms from entering the business and to fend off the threat of substitute products or services. Preferably, this competitive advantage over other players in the business should be sustainable over a prolonged period of time. [B. De Wit and R. Meyer]\n „An enterprise is said to have sustainable competitive advantage when i) it is capturing more economic value than the average firm in its industry and ii) other firms are unable to duplicate the benefits of this strategy.” [Barney, 1991]\n A competitive position can usually not be considered sustainable or defensible for ever. Sooner or later, competitors will find ways to match the advantage.\nDominante explanations As reminded by Nag (\u0026nbsp; [Nag07] \u0026nbsp;) the field of strategic management is relatively young and intersects with several academic fields such as economics, sociology, marketing, finance and psychology. Initially named \u0026lsquo;Business Policy\u0026rsquo;, it was renamed in the early 80\u0026rsquo;s as Strategic Management after Schendel and Hofer\u0026rsquo;s book \u0026ldquo;Strategic Management: A New View of Business Policy and Planning\u0026rdquo;.\n  Since the early 90\u0026rsquo;s the academic debate is dominated by the controversy between the two major theories that have been developed by scholars in strategic management, to explain and identify the conditions under which some organizations can create and sustain performance differentials\n Market-View Theory: mainly stems from industrial economics and considers that over performance ties in with market power and power negotiation. Over-performance arises from the structure of the market and is deeply rooted into positioning the firm in its product-market arena. Strategic choices must select the market in which to participate and how to position the firm within these markets. The sustainability of the advantage depends from structural barriers (e.g. barriers to entry, barriers to exit).\n Resource-Based Theory: offers a wider spectrum of potential sources of over-performance. Distinctive, valuable firm-level capabilities built over time and that competitors are unable to reproduce, support the differential ability of firms. The advantage relies less on the industry structure and more on the specific abilities that a firm can mobilize to respond more effectively and efficiently to customers’ needs. Sustainability is associated with the cost that would incur less efficient firms to copy the most performant firms.\n  The central research research question for strategic management is to understand “why do some firms persistently outperform others” [Barney, 2007]\n Practitioners, for their part, not only seek to understand the origins of outperformance but try also to find ways to maximize the performance of their organization. Indeed they are not interested in making predictions only, but also seek to make prescriptions.\nThe Market View of the firm The market-based theory of the firm derives from micro economics and industrial organization, in particular from the structure, conduct and performance developed by Bain (\u0026nbsp; [Bain54] \u0026nbsp;) . A vast strategic management literature has been devoted to that model, initially articulated by Michael Porter (\u0026nbsp; [Porter79] \u0026nbsp;) who is among the most prominent figures associated with the market-based theory of the firm and competition.\n Competition is at the core of the success of failure of firms. Competition determines the appropriateness of a firm\u0026rsquo;s activities that can contribute to its performance. Porter85\n According to the proponents of the market-view, competition is central and is and at the core of economic exchanges: „ Competition is one of the society’s most powerful forces for making things better in many fields of human endeavor ” (\u0026nbsp; [Porter2008b] \u0026nbsp;) . In all his writing, Porter strongly advocates the freedom of unrestricted development in all spheres of human activities and for instance notes that „ Competition has spread all sectors of society worldwide and now embraces fields like the arts, education, health care and philanthropy ”.\n  As stressed in (\u0026nbsp; [Magreta11] \u0026nbsp;) to succeed a firm shall not seek to be the best but rather to become unique.\nTwo ideas are central to Porter’s beliefs and theory:\n Strategy is about being different: Porter argues that competitive strategy is about being different, which requires deliberately choosing a different way to deliver a mix of values (i.e. to perform different activities than rivals or to perform activities differently). Outperforming rivals requires establishing and maintaining dissimilarities.\n Strategy is about saying no. A now classical saying in strategy is: „ you can’t be everything to everybody ”. What is meant is that firms must decide which business they’re in. Then they should focus on that business only. If necessary they should have the courage to turn off some activities / customer groups that do no longer fit their strategy.\n  To Porter, Strategy is a set of deliberate, consistent and relevant actions that explain why some firm can sustainably over-perform.\nCompanies are in strategic competition when they choose to adopt different paths. The success of a company shouldn\u0026rsquo;t depend on the failure of its competitors. [Magreta 11]\n According to Porter, the two major factors that influence how profitable individual firms will be are the industry structure within which they compete and how they position themselves against that structure.\nDoes operational excellence contribute to strategy? In a famous article (\u0026nbsp; [Porter96] \u0026nbsp;) Porter insists that although Operational Excellence contributes to superior performance, it should not be confused with Strategy. In his views, both operational effectiveness and strategy are essential to superior performance but the two approaches work in completely different.\n  Operational effectiveness aims at performing similar activities better than rivals. By contrast, strategic positioning entails\n „Operational Effectiveness is about doing more for less while Strategy is about being different: performing different activities from rivals’ or performing similar activities in a different ways” [Porter].\n Porter calls productivity frontier the sum of all existing best practices at any point in time. This is the best value a company can produce at that time. However the productivity frontier is constantly shifting outward with the introduction of both new technologies and new management approaches. Operational Excellence produces absolute improvement in productivity, which generates relative improvement for no firm (all the gains are captured by customers, technology providers, advisers and consultants).\nOperational Excellence leads to Strategic Convergence Alone Operational Excellence leads to strategic convergence (level playing field – all companies become identical). Indeed any improvement gets quickly copied and imitated by competitors. By focusing on operational effectiveness only, firms are contesting a race down identical paths. To the extreme, industry consolidation is the only way to escape massive value destruction.\nIs Lean Management a strategy ? It became obvious in the 80’s, that the performance of Japanese factories was by far overshooting any American and/or European standard. Despite their lower production volume, they were delivering higher profitability and better quality with lower inventory levels, less space and much faster throughput.\nFor the proponents of the Market-View theory, Lean Management is not a strategy. The founder of the Boston Consulting Group declared : „until the causes of the differences can be explained the underpinnings corporate strategy are suspect” (Bruce Henderson).\n Over time Toyota created systems that continually worked on eliminating all unnecessary work (\u0026ldquo;non-value adding work\u0026rdquo; or waste) thereby incurring less total costs, and using capital more productively that its competitors. The common denominator of all Toyota\u0026rsquo;s efforts is time. [O. Fiume - \u0026ldquo;Lean is a Strategy\u0026rdquo;]\n For most lean experts however, Lean Management as introduced by Toyota (Toyota Management System) leverages time to differentiate from competitors.\nThe Industry Effect Porter has created various analysis frameworks that establish fundamental logical relationships:\n to be more profitable than others, a firm need to sell at a higher price or to produce at a lower cost;\n competition within an industry depends on five-forces\n a firm is characterized by a set of activities.\n     «In essence, the job of the strategist is to understand and cope with competition. Competition for profits goes beyond established industry rivals to include four other competitive forces as well : customers, suppliers, potential entrants and substitute products. The extended rivalry that results from all five forces defines an industry’s structure and shapes the nature of competitive interaction within an industry. […] The point of industry analysis is not to declare the industry attractive or unattractive but to understand the underpinning s of competition and root cause of profitability » – [Porter,1979].\n   Frameworks to further analyze and understand external \u0026amp; internal factors will be detailed in the section that deals with Value Architecture.\nGrant (\u0026nbsp; [Grant91] \u0026nbsp;) mentions several studies performed by different scholars that sought to establish the respective importance of the industry and firm effects respectively. None of the analyses are considered as decisive. Still it shows that although there is undoubtely an industry effect, it is usually not fully explaining the overall performance.\nBarney (\u0026nbsp; [Barney91] \u0026nbsp;) underlines that the market-view of the firm focuses on competitive imperfections in product markets to explain persistent differences in firm performance. The 5-forces framework (see later) is for instance, one of the most prominent tools to underline such imperfection and identify opportunities to earn superior returns. However, whether a firm can gain a competitive advantage doesn’t depend solely on strategies that create competitive imperfections in product markets but as well on the total cost of implementing these strategies (which is determined by the competitiveness of the strategic factors).\nHow to measure Value for the Firm ? Value creation corresponds to the total perceived value net from the total expenses (the cost of all the factors) incurred to design, produce and deliver the product or service.\n  Some of this value is transferred to customers (Customer’s surplus) and some (the difference between the transaction price and the total cost of the good) is kept by the firm. Any firm must ensure that it both creates value at least for some customer groups and claims value so that it can generates some profit.\nThe total created value is (not necessarily equitably) shared between the Customer\u0026rsquo;s surplus (transferred to the customer) and and the captured value kept by the firm.\n Porter\u0026rsquo;s Generic Strategies To be competitive at all, a firm must ensure that all its customers see sufficient value so that they are prepared to purchase its products and services at a price that exceeds the costs of supply. In addition, if the firm has a advantage it becomes able to claim more value than its competitors.\n As stated by Besanko, a firm can generate more economic value than others by either i) configuring its value chain differently from competitors or ii) by performing activities better than rivals, while configuring its value chain essentially as all the others.\n   For Porter and the Positioning School there are two fundamental ways, to set a firm apart from its competitors and build an advantage:\n Differentiation delivering greater value to customers in exchange for a premium. There are fundamentally three sources of differentiation : product attributes (innovation, quality), pseudo-differentiation (advertising, brand notoriety) and geography.\n Cost leadership creating comparable value far more efficiently than competitors. A firm undergoing a cost leadership strategy will be characterized by very thigh cost discipline and will for instance, seek to benefit from economies of scale and scope.\n  In addition, Porter adds a further dimension subject to the scope that the business choses to serve. Indeed a company can either focus on narrow customer segments or target broad range of customers.\nCost Leadership A firm seeking to undergo a cost leadership strategy, will concentrate on the following drivers:\n Reduce input costs labor, raw materials, procured components. The firm is also likely to consider relocating some activities to low cost countries.\n Seek economies of scale increase production volume to reduce the ave- rage cost per unit (e.g. fixed costs amortization, \u0026hellip;).\n Seek experience effect speed-up production ramp-up and steepen the learning curve which improve staff productivity. Early entrants may gain an advantage. Likewise firms gaining and holding the highest cumulative volume are better off.\n Design Process Approaches such as DFM (Designed for Manufacturing), DFA (Designed for Assembly), Lean management, Six Sigmas to optimize workflow \u0026amp; process efficiency.\n  Cost leadership implies having the lowest costs in the industry. There can be only one cost leader per industry. Firms shouldn’t pursue a cost leadership strategy in total disregard for quality. They basically have two options:\n Parity in service /product. The firm offer a product/service that has the same perceived value than other products in the market, trades at the same price but can be produced at a lower cost. The cost advantage trans- lates into extra profit compared to the average firm.\n Proximity The firm decides to downgrade some characteristics of the product which allows for far more efficient costs while not translating into large price cut.\n  Differentiation A differentiation strategy involves uniqueness along some dimension, that is sufficiently valued by customers to allow a price premium. Various competitors may select different dimension and therefore there might be more than one differentiation strategy.\nUsually differentiation comes at a cost (e.g. additional R\u0026amp;D, additional capex, branding, customer care, etc). Firms however, must check that their customers are ready to pay the product/service in excess to these additional costs.\nIt should be underlined that a higher perceived value means that (some) customers recognize that the product/service is superior and are are willing to pay more for it. This should not be confused with offering a different value pro- position which may not necessarily yield higher prices.\nFocus Strategies A focus strategy targets a narrow segment of a domain of activities and tailors its products and services to the needs of that specific segment to the exclusion of any other.\nThe focuser achieves competitive advantage by dedicating itself to serving its target better than any other competitors can do. For instance, Ryanair targets price sensitive passengers with no need to connecting flights.\nSuccessful focus strategies depend on:\n Distinct Segment Needs should the distinctiveness of the segment erode, the advantage of focussing would vanish. For instance, RIM initially targeted its BlackBerry at business users. As there are no longer any difference between a mobile phone for business purpose and for general purpose, RIM has lost its advantage and is struggling to stay in business.\n Distinct Value Chain addressing distinct customer groups with different means (i.e. more efficiently that what non-focussed competitors would do).\n Viable Economic Segment to be successful, a focus strategy must tackle a business segment that is large enough. The demand must be sustainable and solvent.\n  Stuck in the middle According to Porter, firms must choose between the three generic strategies. Any attempt to compromise and combine more than one generic strategy would result in destroying company value.\nComplement: Porter\u0026rsquo;s Positions At a more detailed level, strategic positions emerge from three sources (\u0026nbsp; [Porter98] \u0026nbsp;) that are not mutually exclusive and often overlap.\n Variety-based positioning produces a subset of an industry’s products or services. It is based on the choice of product or service varieties rather than customer segments. Thus, for most customers, this type of positioning will only meet a subset of their needs. It is economically feasibly only when a company can best produce particular products or services using distinctive sets of activities.\n Needs-based positioning serves most or all the needs of a particular group of customers. It is based on targeting a segment of customers. It arises when there are a group of customers with differing needs, and when a tailored set of activities can serve those needs best.\n Access-based positioning segments customers who are accessible in different ways. Although their needs are similar to those of other customers, the best configuration of activities to reach them is different. Access can be a function of customer geography or customer scale or of anything that requires a different set of activities to reach customers in the best way.\n  The Resource-Based Theory The Resource-based model results from the contributions of several pivotal scholars such as (\u0026nbsp; [Amit93] [Barney91] [Barney97] [Penrose59] [Peteraf93] [Pisano] [Teece97] [Wernerfelt84] \u0026nbsp;) and was initially formalized by Barney in his seminal article of 1991.\nBy contrast to the market-view of the firm, the RBT – Resource-Based Theory aka Resource-Based View of the firm – makes two assumptions in analyzing sources of competitive advantage:\n Firms within an industry (or a strategic group) may differ with respect to the strategic resources they control.\n These strategic resources may not be perfectly mobile among firms and therefore heterogeneity can be long lasting.\n  A resource is \u0026lsquo;any asset, capability, organizational process, firm attribute, information, knowledge that enables a firm to fulfill the activities in its value chain\u0026rsquo; - (\u0026nbsp; [Puranam16] \u0026nbsp;) The proponents of the resource-based view (or Resource-based theory) of the firm, outline that in a fast changing external environment, internal resources and capacities can provide a more secure foundation to long-term strategy.\n The RBV is a business performance model focusing on resources and capabilities controlled by the firm (business unit) as a main source of competitive advantage and performance. Dynamic Capabilities View (Di Stefano, Peteraf, \u0026amp; Verona, 2010; Drnevich \u0026amp; Kriauciunas, 2011; Helfat \u0026amp; Peteraf, 2009; Teece, 2007; Teece, et al., 1997), a recent and promising development within the field, is sometimes considered as an extension of RBV framework (Eisenhardt \u0026amp; Martin, 2000).\n With the market-based view, also known as the outside-in or positioning approach, firms see themselves through the industry and market they serve. The key strategic questions are ’what is our business?’, or ’what are the customers\u0026rsquo; needs that we fulfill?’. By contrast, the resource-based view of the firm adopts an inside-out approach and focuses on the firm’s internal capabilities: \u0026lsquo;what are our specific skills and capabilities?\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;what do we do better than the others?\u0026rsquo;.\n For RBT, resources are \u0026ldquo; the stock of available factors that are owned or controlled by the firm \u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [Amit93] \u0026nbsp;) and strategy becomes the continuing search for rent or return in excess of a resource owner’s opportunity costs, where owning a competitive advantage can drive above normal rates of return.\nExample: the Kodac Case KODAC was the undisputed leader in chemical imaging photographic products. However, with the introduction of a superior product (digital photography) returns dropped quickly. In response, KODAC decided that coping with this new substitute would be its number one strategic priority\n  For years, Kodak has unsuccessfully invested billions to fight against emerging technologies and to transpose its leadership to digital imaging, considering it was still the same industry and it wanted to restore its leadership position.\n Grant raises the question : „might have KODAK been better-off sticking with its chemical know-how and developing its interest in specialty chemicals, for instance, pharmaceuticals or healthcare” ([Grant, 2006]).\n Example: Google seats in various industries Google was established in 1998 as a web search engine company. In this ’industry’ Google faced Yahoo, Bing and other similar firms specialized in indexing and retrieving web pages.\nSoon, Google extended its activities and entered other industries (then facing new competitors) such as software applications (Maps, Chrome, Google Apis), operating systems (Android), Web content \u0026amp; social networks (Google news, Google+, gmail), application and data hosting (Google cloud).\n  In the words of Larry Page \u0026amp; Sergey Bin the co-founders, Google’s mission is „to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful\u0026rdquo;. Google doesn’t see itself through either the markets they address (it may change over time) or their competitors. On the contrary, they define themselves by a set of capabilities.\nKey Assumptions of the theory Organization are not identical:\n they have different capabilities, in other words resources are heterogeneously distributed among firms (i.e. not all firms own all resources). Scott (\u0026nbsp; [Scott08] \u0026nbsp;) stresses that the relevance of a resource is highly contextual and depends in particular on the selected business model. A resource can be key to one firm and just not fit with another within the same industry.\n Resources are imperfectly mobile (i.e. resources stick with their owner) and therefore differences between organizations are rather stable. This explains the existence of differences across firms in resource endowments and why this differences may persist over time [Barney 91].\n A competitive advantage \u0026amp; superior performance of a firm is explained by the distinctiveness of its capabilities. Acquiring specific capabilities is usually a long and costly process. In addition, it may be difficult to establish a causal relationship between a level of performance and a set of capabilities.\n  The Resource-based model hinges upon the assumptions that i) a firm can hold a competitive advantage if it controls and exploits capabilities that are both valuable and rare,ii) a firm can sustain this advantage if capabilities are inimitable and non-substitutable and iii) this translates into long-term over-performance.\n The resource-based approach helps explaining why a company possesses a competitive advantage (single business) and/or a corporate advantage (in the set of businesses it operates).\n „While a competitive advantage may be achieved by luck, a sustainable advantage requires a resource and competence-sensitive strategy process” ([Barney, 1986]).\n Although the wording may vary among academics (and also among practitioners) the model hinges upon the concept of a specific bundle of resources that a firm has built up and accumulated over time (resources are stocks of assets and capabilities). Firms are therefore constrained by the resources they possess but also protected if it takes time for competition to copy their very resources.\nThe resources \u0026amp; competences framework can be used to scan the various businesses in which a firm could develop a competitive advantage, based on its existing capabilities. Likewise it may highlight the capability gaps in a given business.\n  There are fundamentally four categories of resources:\n Physical capital geographical location, plants, machinery and physical technology,\n Financial capital equity, debt, access to debt market, rating,\n Human capital training, experience, insight, judgment,\n Organizational resources firm culture, reporting structure, formal and informal planning, controlling, reputation\n   „A firm’s ability to earn a rate of profit in excess of its cost of capital depends upon two factors: the attractiveness of the industry in which it is located and its establishment of competitive advantage over rivals. Business strategy should be viewed less as a quest for monopoly rents (the returns to market power) and more as a quest for Ricardian rents (the return to the resources which confer competitive advantage over and above the real costs of the resources).” ([Grant, 1991])\n Resources may be thought of as inputs that an organization possesses or can call upon (e.g. from suppliers) to carry out its activities. Resources can be i) tangible (cash, geographical location, buildings, machinery and equipment, land, mineral reserve,), ii) intangible (technology, patents, copyright, brand name, reputation and notoriety, brands, customer, relationship, culture) or iii) human (skills, know-how, motivation, organizational capabilities, company culture).\nA resource is something that the firm holds and can use to generate value. A resource can be viewed as a productive asset that the firm controls. The tangible, physical resources usually appear on the balance sheet of the firm. By contrast, accountants don’t measure other resources except in case of acquisition (where some resources can ’indirectly’ be recorded as ”Goodwill”).\nResources \u0026amp; Competences Two broad types of capabilities are usually considered :\n Resources are the assets that a firm owns or can call upon (including ties with partners and suppliers). Resources are basically what a firm possesses.\n Competences are the way those assets are used or deployed effectively. That is what a firm does well with what they have.\n    Strategists look in priority for businesses where the existing resources \u0026amp; competences (i.e. that the firm already controls) can be exploited. This is often the reason why firms consider, in priority, diversification in adjacent domains (leveraging the existing customer base or extending the existing products to additional customer groups and hence benefit from economies of scale/scope).\nA Strategic Capability  (resource or competence) contributes to the long-term survival or competitive advantage of an organization.\n Managing Capabilities The difference between the capabilities that must be controlled to become a significant player and the capabilities already controlled by the firm is a way to measure the level of matching (or strategic fit). However, the analysis must not be limited to systematically filling a grid, but on the contrary to highlight the few capabilities that are decisive to enter a business and generate sustainable profits.\n  A Threshold Capability is the capability level needed to meet the necessary requirements to exist in a given market and/or establish a business.\n A Distinctive Capability is the capability level that may be the basis of achieving competitive advantage and delivering superior performance.\n When gaps are identified (and there are usually gaps), the firm can explore various options to fill them. First, the firm can try to develop ”in-house” additional capabilities (acquire the missing resources, learn new competence). The firm can also look for other companies that could be complementary and bring the missing capabilities through alliances, partnerships or merger\n  According to the RBT, the basis of competitive advantage may lie in aspects of the organization that are difficult to discern or be specific about. However capabilities are highly dynamic (competitors may manage to copy or imitate a set of capabilities) and therefore they must be carefully and proactively managed. Firms have fundamentally three options to manage strategic capabilities:\n Internal capability management a firm may decide to reinforce its existing capabilities. This includes i) leveraging capabilities from one area of the business to others and ii) stretching capabilities i.e. build new services / products out of existing capabilities.\n Growing capabilities through external developments such as M\u0026amp;A and/or Strategic alliance building.\n Ceasing activities when the gap becomes too high or the advantage too narrow, a company may be better off exiting this specific area of business and refocussing on other domains.\n  Capturing Value: The Collins \u0026amp; Montgomery\u0026rsquo;s Framework Collins \u0026amp; Montgomery (\u0026nbsp; [Collins95] \u0026nbsp;) consider that ”Value creation” lies at the confluence of demand, scarcity and appropriability. Value is created when a resource is demanded by creditworthy customers, when it can barely be replicated by competition and when the firm can easily capture the profit it generates.\n „the challenge for manager is understand what distinguishes valuable from pedestrian resources and to use that knowledge to craft strategies that generate an enduring competitive advantage.” [Collins Montgomery]\n    Creditworthy demand\nA resource is valuable to the extend that is meets customers’ demand and allow to serve customers better than competition. Although it sounds obvious, firms tend to forget that a valuable resource must help meeting customer demand and fulfilling a customer’s need at a price the customer is willing to pay.\nAn analysis of a firm’s resource should therefore not focus on an internal assessment only but also clarify how the firm’s stock of resources translate into fulfilling customers’ expectation better than competition. In addition, as both customer demand and alternate value proposition may evolve, firms must reassess periodically the value of their resources and try to anticipate losses of value.\n „A resource value derives from its application in product market. It traces back from the ultimate satisfaction of customers”* [Peteraf \u0026amp; Bergen]\n„A resource is valuable if it can generate in someway a rent stream from a product market that can be captured by the firm. A valuable resource must contribute or be involved in the creation of a product or market that has value to customers” [Bowman].\n  Scarcity\nHowever, not all the resources that contribute to meeting customers’ demand can provide a competitive advantage. The condition is necessary but not sufficient. If the resource that the firm possesses is not in short supply of if it can be easily copied or replicated by competition, it is unlikely that it can yield any competitive advantage. Resource scarcity is therefore the second requirement for a resource to contribute to competitive advantage.\nAccording to Collins \u0026amp; Montgomery there are four characteristics that make resources rare and difficult to imitate.\n Physical uniqueness – geographical location, patent, mineral extraction rights, etc. Although firms believe they are well protected against competition when the hold physically unique resources, it however often turns out that such resources are easier to imitate or substitute than expected.\n Path dependency – most resources needs to be gradually accumulated over time (brand name recognition, R\u0026amp;D knowledge, organizational capabilities, etc). Imitators usually need to re-create the path that predecessors took, which protect the first-entrant by delaying imitation. However, when the actual valuable resource is easy to identify, imitator may catch up quickly with the pioneering company.\n Causal ambiguity – external observers can usually infer some correlations between competitive advantage and resources but may fail to disentangle what the truly valuable resource is.\n Economic deterrence – occurs when i) resources are scale sensitive (e.g. capex) ii) the market leader has the capabilities to replicate its resources (e.g. factory) but iii) choses not to do so as market demand is limited. If in addition the resources are specific to a given market (sunk costs), they represent a ’credible commitment’ that the leader will remain in the market and react to any newcomer attempting to enter the market\n   Value Capture\nMeeting customers’ demand and resource inimitability are good ingredient to generate value. However a firm will usually also seek to appropriate and capture value and avoid that somebody else can claim most of the value.\nWhen property rights to the resources are clearly established, profits will flow to the owner of the resources. For this reason, firms are more likely to appropriate profits from the resources they develop themselves than from those they purchase in the market. However there is always a risk that the firm has to pay out its profit to some of its stakeholders (e.g. high salaries to general managers, salesmen, \u0026hellip;).\nCapturing Value: The VRIN Framework Barney (\u0026nbsp; [Barney91] \u0026nbsp;) put forward the popular VRIN checklist to identify whether or not a capability can be strategically important. It underlines on what bases organizational capabilities might become the foundation for sustainable competitive advantage and superior economic performance.\n   Valuable \nObviously a resource (or capability) would be of little use if it doesn’t deliver acceptable return to the firm. A firm should not keep a resource that is not (and cannot be made) valuable. According to the RBV literature, valuable resources are resources that allow a firm either to claim for a premium pricing or to lower its cost compared to its competitors. Barney considers that a valuable resource must enable a firm to do things and behave in a way that lead to higher sales, lower costs, higher margins or in other ways add value to the firm. In other words, resources are valuable when they enable a firm to either improve its efficiency or effectiveness. A valuable resource must allow either exploiting opportunities and/or neutralizing threats. Note : when assessing whether or not a resource is valuable, the key question must be ’valuable for what’ (indeed, a resource can barely be valuable in absolute terms, even the concept of ’resource’ is not absolute).\n Rare \nA firm enjoys a competitive advantage when it creates more economic value than its average competitor. If a valuable resource is highly available among competitors then it is unlikely that it can be the source of any significant advantage. A bundle of resources can generate a competitive advantage as long as the number of firms that can use these re- sources is low compared to the total number of firms in that particular industry. Capabilities that are owned by a large number of firms cannot confer competitive advantage, indeed if competitors have similar capabilities they can quickly respond to any strategic initiative. A Capability that is not rare can still be necessary ; it won’t be considered strategically important though.\n Inimitable \nValuable and rare resources can only be a source of sustainable competitive advantage if the average player cannot easily replicate or obtain these resources: the cost of getting a resources should exceed the likely economic profit it would yield. Otherwise, any competitive advantage will be short-lived. Barney outlines three reasons why resources would be imperfectly imitable (or costly to imitate):\n ability to obtain the resource is dependent on unique historical conditions (including first-mover advantage or ripple effect from resources acquired in the past)\n link between the resource and the advantage is causally ambiguous (i.e. it is not easy to understand which are the resources that yield the advantage and this is often true of the firm that enjoys the advantage. Indeed very often managers consider some resources as implicit and cannot easily outline the firm’s recipe for outperformance. For instance because some intangible assets – e.g. teamwork – can be hidden and/or because a complex network of interrelated intangible and organizational resources is at play)\n resource (capability) is socially complex - which includes interpersonal relationships ; a firm’s culture, a firm’s reputation among its peers, its suppliers and customers.\n   Non-substitutable \nThere must be no strategically equivalent valuable resources that are themselves neither rare nor inimitable. It is generally argued that to achieve strategic advantage from a capability it needs to be developed internally and should not be freely traded in the market. In- deed, if a valuable, rare and imperfectly imitable resource can be easily substituted by a set of resources that would yield similar effects while being easy to duplicate and/or easy to acquire at low cost then it is unlikely that any competitive advantage can be long lasting.\nThe VRIO Framework Before being re-dubbed ’VRIN’, Barney’s framework was known as ’VRIO’ where ’O’ stands for Organized.\n  The thought behind stressing that a firm had to be aligned with its own strategy was that possession or control of VRIN resources is necessary but not sufficient to gain an advantage. Indeed the firm must be ready to leverage its re- sources and capture value. This encompasses capacities such as incentive and monitoring systems, formal and informal reporting , interface and collaboration among customer facing and support Functions. In other words, a firm that possesses a valuable and rare resource will not gain a competitive advantage unless it can actually put that resource to effective use.\n „ For instance, for many years Novell had a significant competitive advantage in computer networking based on its core NetWare product. In high-technology industries, remaining at the top requires continuous innovation. Novell’s de- cline during the mid- to late 1990s led many to speculate that Novell was unable to innovate in the face of changing markets and technology. However, shortly after new CEO Eric Schmidt arrived from Sun Microsystems to attempt to turnaround the firm, he arrived at a different conclusion. Schmidt commented : ”I walk down Novell hallways and marvel at the incredible potential of innovation here. But, Novell has had a difficult time in the past turning innovation into products in the marketplace.” He later commented to a few key executives that it appeared the company was suffering from ’organizational constipation’. Novell appeared to still have innovative resources and capabilities, but they lacked the organizational capability such as product development and marketing, to get those new products to market in a timely manner.” (Stephen Laughnet - Principles of Management)\n This example stresses how much it is important to ’start with the end in mind’ and thoroughly identifies all the resources that are needed. A fantastic research lab with track records in unveiling breakthrough technology (e.g. the Palo Alto Research Centre invented the laser printer, the graphical user interface, the mouse device, the ethernet and tons of other technologies) is a rare resource, but if the objective is to deliver innovative product to the market (i.e. capturing value from the innovation) then producing innovation is just half-way to the target. Once all the capabilities (or resources) are identified, the firm must look for ways to derive a sustainable competitive advantage, that is ensure that at list some of the resources are rare, imperfectly imitable and non-substituable. It is paramount to understand that an uncorrelated bundle of VRIN resource is usually yielding no value at all.\nComplement: the development of the RBT The initial development of the Resource-Based Theory (RBT) of the firm (\u0026nbsp; [Wernerfelt84] [Wernerfelt95] \u0026nbsp;) was aimed a re-stating Porter’s results from a different perspective (hence the initial name Resource-Based ’View’).\nIn 1984, Wernerfelt published an article where he suggests that Porter’s theory of competitive advantage could be restated from the assumptions that firms develop or acquire capabilities. In this perspective the resource-based view of the firm is a dual representation of the market-based view. While Porter had focussed on barriers and mobility constraints among industries, Wernerfelt’s intuition was that the competitive advantage a firm enjoys in the market had to be tied to some internal resources it controls, has acquired or developed. Indeed, the Resource-Based View considers that a competitive advantage derives from specific resources \u0026amp; competences controlled by the firm. RBV sees a firm as a set of resources and capacities that can get configured to over perform competition, hence leading to competitive advantage. Therefore the RBV does not point at the industry structure but at the unique cluster of resources and capabilities that each organization possesses and/or want to develop.\nThe same year, Rumelt published a paper where he establishes a theory of firm performance, rooted in the resources that a firm controls and its capacity to generate economic rents. To a large extend he also considers the conditions under which a firm would be the adequate way to generate and capture economic rents as opposed to other form of organization (this is also the question addressed by Williamson through the Transaction Costs theory, although from a different angle).\nTeece merged the two theories and argued that the relations among business that are the most likely to be a source of economic profit (resource-based theory) are also the kinds of relations that are difficult to manage through non-hierarchical forms of governance (opportunism risk associated with transactions costs).\n As highlighted by Grant ([Grant, 1991]) the development of the Resource-based theory as an alternative to the market view, may be an answer to fast changing customers needs: „In a world where customer preferences are volatile, the identity of customers is changing and the technologies for serving customer requirements are continually evolving, an external focused orientation does not provide a secure foundation for formulating long term strategy. The firm’s own resources and capabilities may be a much more stable basis on which to define its identity” (\u0026nbsp; [Grant91] \u0026nbsp;) .\n In 1986, Barney showed that if firms would acquire strategic factors from a perfectly competitive market then this market would anticipate the performance that these factors would bring when used to implement product market strategies. In such an event, even imperfectly competitive product market would no longer be the source of economic rents.\nItanami (1987) introduced the concept of invisible assets (information-based resource, technology, customer trust, brand image, control of distribution, corporate culture and management skills). He considers that while physical assets are necessary, invisible assets are the source of outperformance because they are hard and time-consuming to accumulate.\nThe resource-based theory encompasses several branches and school of thoughts, each with its own specific field of study and objective.\n   Approach Main authors Objectives     Resource-based view Barney, Wernerfelt Delineate and nurture \u0026lsquo;VRIN\u0026rsquo; resources to generate sustainable competitive advantage.

Competence or Capabilities Essentially, RBT conceptualizes the firm as a bundle of resources. It is these resources, and the way that they are combined, that makes firms different from one another and in turn allows a firm to deliver products and services in the market. However resources in themselves do not confer any value to organizations. Resources have a potential use but alone are unproductive and do not confer any value in themselves to organizations. Value generation requires combining the adequate resources and the necessary skills. Competences are the most intangible and correspond to the activities, modus operandi and processes through which a firm can effectively use its resources. A competence is what a firm does well.\nOrganizational capability requires the expertise of various individuals to be integrated with capital equipment, technology and other resources (e.g. a brain surgeon if of little value if not complemented by an hospital, surgical instruments and equipment, a full team of skilled people, etc).\n„There is a key distinction between resources and capabilities. Resources are inputs into the production process but on their own few resources are productive. Productive activity requires the cooperation and coordination of teams of resources. A capability is the capacity for a team of resources to perform some task or activity. While resources are the source of a firm’s capabilities, capabilities are the main source of its competitive advantage” ([Grant, 1991]).\nSpecific capabilities correspond to the (possibly unique) technologies mastered. Capabilities are activities that the firm does particularly well compared to competition. For instance, CANON offers a large spectrum of apparently uncorrelated products: camera, printers, fax-machines, copy-machines, video camera, etc. In all these products, a few fundamental capabilities are paramount: precision mechanics, micro-electronic and fine optics.\nLikewise, 3M built its impressive product portfolio (in excess of 30.000 products) on the foundation of i) a few key technologies: adhesives, thin-film coatings and ii) the ability to market and launch new products. (adapted from [Grant, 2006])\nJon Kay (\u0026nbsp; [Kay95] \u0026nbsp;) distinguishes three fundamental types of distinctive capabilities:\n Architecture comprises the system of contracts and relationships between the firm and its ecosystem (employees, customers, partners, suppliers, distributors, etc). Organizations depend far less on individual leaders than they do on their established structures, dominant styles and organizational routines (ways of working). Often, the relationships will be implicit and complex, with little formalization if any. In markets where the quality of products is derived from long-term experience, reputation is usually also a source of distinctive capability.\n Reputation brand notoriety, customer’s experience, quality signals, word of mouth spreading, etc. A well managed reputation can be extended to new products\n Innovation new technologies, new processes, introduction of new pro- ducts, but also finding applications for existing underused technologies (e.g. 3M derived post-it notes from low-quality adhesive).\n  Distinctive capabilities are necessary but not sufficient for success. Capabilities must also be sustainable – it needs to persist over time – and appropriable (i.e. to benefit primarily to the organization rather than its employees, its customers or its competitors). A sustained competitive advantage occurs when an organization is implementing a value-creating strategy that is not being implemented by current or potential competitors and when these competitors are unable to duplicate the benefits of the strategy. A competitive advantage may get eroded as the industry changes but won’t get competed away by competitors\nCore Competence Prahalad and Hamel (\u0026nbsp; [Prahalad90] \u0026nbsp;) call core competence any competence that a firm masters particularly well, compared to its competitors.\nIn their view, a ”Core competence” i) should provide access to a wide variety of markets (e.g. Honda’s capabilities in engine design - cars, lawnmowers, powerboats), ii) should make a significant contribution to the perceived customer benefits of the end products (e.g. BMW, excellence in engineering) and last but not least, iii) it should be difficult for competitors to imitate.\nIn addition, for a core competence to have any lasting value to the organization the competitive advantage that derives from its use must be sustainable. In their seminal paper, Prahalad and Hamel emphasize that „in the short-run a company’s competitiveness derives from price/performance attributes. However competitors are all quickly converging on similar standards for product cost \u0026amp; quality. [\u0026hellip;] In the long-run competitiveness derives from an ability to build , at a lower cost and more speedily than competitors, the core competence that spawn unanticipated products”.\nThe real sources of advantage are to be found in management’s ability to consolidate corporate wide technologies and production skills into competencies that empower individual business to adapt quickly to changing opportunities.\nCore competencies are the collective learning in organization, especially how to coordinate diverse production skills and integrate multiple streams of technologies. Unlike physical assets that do deteriorate over time, competencies are enhanced as they are applied and shared (knowledge also fades away if it is not used). Competencies are the glue that binds existing business and are also the engine for new business development. Pattern of diversification and market entry can be guided by competencies and not just by market attractiveness.\nDynamic Capabilities The ability of a firm to renew and recreate its strategic capabilities and meet the needs of changing environments, is in itself a key strategic resource. Indeed capabilities that are the basis of competitive success soon get copied by competitors and become standard practice of the industry. To continue to be effective overtime, capabilities can’t remain static but on the contrary need to adapt. By and large, three categories of dynamic capabilities can be identified: i) ability to sense new opportunities, ii)ability to seize an opportunity (i.e. to make a choice) and iii) ability to re-configure the firm’s capabilities.\nMore than the list of capabilities that a firm controls, what matter is the relative level with respect to competition in the capabilities that significantly contribute to the realization of the core business. When the firm is short of some capabilities, the management must create an imbalance (what Hamel \u0026amp; Prahalad call \u0026ldquo;stretch \u0026amp; leverage\u0026rdquo;), that forces the company to increase its capabilities to become more efficient and effective relative to competition.\nCompetitive advantage as a result of rents The strategic management literature considers that broadly speaking there are two sources of superior profitability:\n industry attractiveness which stems from market power, barriers to entry, etc and can be assimilated to what economists call monopoly rents. It is earned by a firm that enjoys a legally enforced or de facto monopoly (i.e. is the only firm to satisfy some customers’ requirements) and is also contingent on demand elasticity, which depends on the availability of substitutes.\n scarce resource control (firm-specific assets such as patents, trademarks, brand reputation, distribution channel, key technologies, installed base, etc) that economists call Ricardo rents, earned by a firm that possesses valuable and rare factors.\n innovation that can generate what economists call Schumpeterian rents during the period of time between the introduction of an innovation and its successful diffusion (and until it gets imitated).\n   The superior performance of a firm arises from sustainable competive advantages that are the result of either monopoly rents, Ricardian rents or Schumpeterian rents (Peteraf93, Powell01, Wang14)\u0026rdquo;\n To economists „A a rent is any payment to a factor of production (i.e. resource) in excess of its opportunity cost” [Krugman 16]\n Ricardo Rent Ricardo rents are often considered as the tangible materialization of a competitive advantage.\n „The Law of Rent states that the rent of a land site is equal to the economic advantage obtained by using the site in its most productive use, relative to the advantage obtained by using marginal (i.e., the best rent-free) land for the same purpose, given the same inputs of labor and capital” * (D. Ricardo, An Essay on the influence of a low price of corn on the profits of stock, 1809)\n David Ricardo, a British economist, introduced the concept with an example borrowed from agriculture.\nLet’s consider the business of growing wheat and assuming that ’land’ is the only significant factor of production. Back in the XIX century it was indeed the case as i) labor-cost was insignificant ii) there was very little capital investment in farming i.e. no agricultural machinery, duty trucks and iii) operating expenses such as fertilizers, pesticide, etc were inexistent.\nAt first, only the most most fertile parcels of land are under cultivation. At a certain point, all such land is used and population increase force into cultivation inferior lands: additional crops are seeded on less fertile parcels to meet the new demand. The cost to produce one unit of crop in inferior lands is superior to the cost of producing the same quantity in superior lands. On the market, however there will be only one price (that needs to be greater than or equal to the cost of production on inferior land). This counterintuitive result (raising the total quantity produced will cause the price to also raise) illustrates that the best lands (scarce resources) will benefit an extra return (the difference between the cost of production in superior and inferior lands).\nIndustry Lifecycle Any thorough analysis of an industry should take into account the stage of development of that industry.\nAt least four stages should be considered:\nLaunch (or initial development, or product introduction): the industry is still experimental in many ways. It usually consists of very few players with very differentiated products. There is little direct rivalry. Even if the industry doesn’t collapse, it is very likely that not all players will make it to the next stage.\nHigh Growth rivalry remains low as the market offers high opportunities. If barriers to entry are low, new players will be attracted which will increase rivalry.\nShakeout demand approaches saturation levels. A significant portion of demand correspond to replacement because fewer first-time buyers remain. As firms have been accustomed to high growth they may continue to add capacity at a rate that become inconsistent with actual demand and translates into over capacity.\nMaturity the market is totally saturated, demand limited to replacement and the growth rate declines. Rivalry is likely to increase as players can only gain new revenues at the expense of their competitors (zero-sum games) which impact prices. Some players will seek to exit the market which may drive more consolidation of the industry. Barriers to entry will usually increase (and as a result the threat to new entrant is vanishing). Firms that remain in the market will seek to drive their cost down and build strong brand loyalty. Periodic price wars may occur among surviving players\nDecline growth become seriously negative and no more investments on products/services (substitution products are getting more traction). Players seek to harvest as much as they can before leaving the industry. The degree of rivalry usually decrease. However if exit barriers are high and the decline is quick, the industry is likely to suffer overcapacity (as in the shakeout phase) which can trigger fierce price wars.\n   Stage Launch Growth Shakeout Decline     Nb players Very Few More Many Concentration   Product Diff. Highly differentiated Converging Commodity Commodity   Direct Rivalry low  low high low   New entries few Many None Exit    Strategizing in Mature Industry A mature industry is characterized by i) limited growth and ii) a bunch of large companies (small and medium companies can co-exist as well but would represent a rather limit cumulated market share).\nEntrenched players are very aware of the strategic nature of their interaction. They know that changing any attribute of their business model can trigger a chain of reactions and unbalance the industry equilibrium. As a result, established companies often seek to collectively moderate the intensity of competition (this can not be formally agreed in most countries - antitrust laws - however several signaling mechanisms can be used).\nEntry Deterrence Existing players can deploy several strategies (all these strategies are carefully witnessed by anti-trust authorities) to prevent the entry of new players:\n Product proliferation incumbent players attempt to limit new entries by making sure every market segments and market niches is well served (saturated). This prevent potential new players from gaining experience, scale and brand at the lower end of the market and then progressively move upmarket.\n Limit price when economies of scale are not sufficient to discourage potential new entrants, incumbent players can (in the short run) charge a price that is lower than the profit-maximizing price to artificially cap profits (and make the industry less attractive).\n Technology upgrading incumbent firms can invest in costly technological upgrades to increase upfront investments for new comers if they want to match the same technology level. Similarly, existing players can speed up research and development and launch more advanced products.\n Strategic Commitments incumbent companies can signal potential entrants that entry will be difficult by committing significant and long term resources (e.g. sunk costs, investment in excess production capacity, etc). As a result, both the perceived cost and risk of entry will raise and limit the likelihood of new comers entering the industry.\n Brand notoriety existing firms can increase their communication and advertising budgets to strengthen their brand at the expense of any potential entrants.\n  Rivalry Management Strong rivalry among incumbents usually translate into price erosion which destroys industry profitability. Several techniques are used by companies to limit profitability losses.\n Price Signaling the technique is basically a tit-for-tat strategy - price moves (increase or decrease) are copied by all the players. Collusion (an explicit agreement between parties to limit open competition) is usually illegal. However, through price signaling companies can exchange information which enables them to understand each other’s pricing policy and converge toward an homogeneous pricing policy across the industry (that optimizes profitability). It can also be a response when a firm decreases its price. The other players will cut their price even more aggressively to stress that the price war initiator stands for more to lose.\n Price Leadership the industry waits for the firm with the highest cost structure (the firm that has the smallest margin) to set its price first. Then competitors offering products in the same market segment align their own prices (within a price range).\n Non-price competition is a strategy where the value transferred to the end-customer is increased while keeping the price untouched (i.e. avoiding price cutting and price war). This is achieved by asymmetrically increasing the customer’s willingness to pay through product differentiation.\n Market penetration is an attempt by one of the existing players to expand its market share (in the existing market). This usually involves aggressive marketing campaigns and advertising to strengthen the brand name. When successful this strategy has a two-fold effect : attracting new customers (from rivals’ customer base) and commanding premium prices.\n Product proliferation see above, the largest players will grow their market presence (offer product in all the segments) in a attempt to increase their market penetration (usually at the expense of the smaller players).\n Product development (see technology upgrading above) stimulate demand for product renewal by introducing new models (e.g. new car mo- del). This will usually go hand-in-hand with new non-price features. This however can drive the industry profitability down as more and more in- novation \u0026amp; development will be needed.\n Market development with this strategy, a company seeks to leverage the notoriety it has developed by starting to compete in new markets/industries (see Corporate Strategy section).\n  "

	"content": " Practitioners have to deal with Ambiguity The word strategy holds a variety of meanings and strategy-making also comes in a vast variety of tastes.\nNo single definition of \u0026lsquo;what strategy should be\u0026rsquo; is accepted (various people may have different perceptions or expectations). Therefore, dealing with strategy elaboration first and foremost requires building a shared interpretation of the problem to be solved.\nWhen the problem at hand is understood, the strategist must establish as well an adequate problem solving approach and strategy development process and leadership. Indeed there is as little convergence on strategy-making that there is about ”what strategy is”.\nLast but not least strategists must find ways to share and convey their findings and recommendations to the various stakeholders.\n  Interpretation Many people, from different Functions, are usually involved in crafting or updating strategies. As there is no unanimously accepted definition, different people will usually have different understandings (and possibly different expectations) of what strategy is or should be.\nIn most firms, strategy is not a standardized professional domain with it’s own recognized body of knowledge (there is no chartered strategist as there are chartered engineers or accountants).\n  Some scholars argue that strategic reasoning is dominantly a logical activity that hinge upon strong analytical skills. The course of action is explicitly derived from an in-depth analysis of the facts and available data.\nHowever despite their seeking to be comprehensive, rigorous and systematic, strategists will hit some shortcomings and cognitive limitations. As stressed by H. Simon \u0026ldquo;people act intentionally rational but only limitedly so\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [Simon57] \u0026nbsp;) .\nOther thinkers are strong proponents of generative reasoning: creating new perspective, unveiling new insights and find new ways to solve problems. According to De Wit \u0026amp; Meyer \u0026ldquo;Creative thinking should be the driving force and logical thinking a supporting means\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;) .\nUnstructured problem Strategy-making is in itself, a process of interpretation. It requires to deeply understand the problem statement, design an effective problem-solving method, discover candidate options and down select the optimal solution.\nAlthough many tools exist, there is no ready-to-use recipe, no tool or framework is a silver bullet that would solve any strategic problem, and each specific case will require its own specific method.\n  Defining and solving strategic problem is primarily a creative activity: questions are ill-defined \u0026amp; highly subjectives (\u0026nbsp; [Ritel73] \u0026nbsp;) . Furthermore, the classes of potential solutions are not known in advance (aka wicked problem). Articulating a strategy becomes then a creative reformulation of the situation.\nFor instance Jim Kecinski (former managing director at Google) stresses that one should \u0026ldquo;tap into the wisdom of crowds to drive innovation and creativity\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;framebreaking ideas can\u0026rsquo;t be found, they have to be generated\u0026rdquo;.\nSergey Brin (Google\u0026rsquo;s co-founder) considers that most successful projects at Google have emerged bottom-up rather than being conceived top-down.\nEfficient Communication Communication skills (sometimes, negotiation skills) are paramount both for facilitating the formulation of a strategy and articulating the recommendations to the decision makers.\nThis usually includes an evaluation of the proposed strategy: is the option(s) suitable in terms of matching opportunities and threats ? is it feasible and does the organization control the adequate capabilities to implement the option(s) ? is it acceptable in the eyes of the main stakeholders ?\n  Once approved, a strategy must also get clearly communicated to all stakeholders.\nPractitioners must have their own inner-compass It is essential that practitioners have their own representation of what strategy means to them. A few models (out of many others) are briefly presented hereafter.\nThe VIP Model According to Frédéric Fréry (\u0026nbsp; [Frery06] \u0026nbsp;) Strategy encompasses three major elements : value, imitation and perimeter.\n On a general level, strategy comprises three objectives: creating value, handling imitation and shaping a perimeter.\n   Value\nStrategy aims at creating sustainable value (from the perspective of customers, shareholders or more broadly any stakeholders), from which short-term and long-term over-performance can be derived.\n The uniqueness of strategy resides in value creation; increasing customer value beyond cost is the seminal assumption of strategy.\nSome organizations take the view that their only responsibility is the short-term interest of shareholders. However, an exclusive focus on financial results does not necessarily align managerial and shareholder interests. Some organizations are mission driven and exclusively concentrate on demonstrating best value for their customers or users. However, this stance can threaten the long-term survival of the organization and when a business reaches effectiveness at the expense of efficiency, it contradicts its basic purpose.\n Defining and assessing value is therefore of the utmost importance. In addition, it is key to understand how value is shared between the firm and its ecosystem.\n A sound strategy must evolve between these extremes of shareholder value and customer satisfaction, profit maximization and corporate social responsibility.\n Furthermore, a firm must both create value and claim value. In other words, a firm must capture some of the value it creates.\nImitation \nA firm is unlikely to continue to over-perform for long, if the recipe for its success can be easily understood and copied.\n Defining a new business model and implementing an innovative value offer is worthless if competitors can quickly catch up.\nAchieving and sustaining success depends on the ability to be unique and remain so. That is why imitation is a central theme in strategy, whether it consists of building and defending a sustainable competitive advantage (how to avoid imitation) or, on the contrary, matching an innovator’s positioning (how to imitate a winning business model).\n When firms cannot find ways of differentiation (doing different things or doing the same things differently) they run the risk of strategic convergence and industry commoditization (standardized product and offers, low margins if any).\n Because the value of any strategic concept resides in its ability to create competitive advantage, the concept becomes irrelevant as soon as it is extensively adopted. Many best practices (ISO standards, Six Sigma, CRM) although once distinctive, have now been widely adopted.\nBecause it makes sense for competitors to mimic successful strategies, there is a great deal of similarity between organizations in many industries. Adopting new perspectives on business allow defining fresh strategic spaces by contrast to conventional business models.\n Perimeter Strategy is also deciding what to do and even more importantly what not to do.\n Beyond designing a valuable business model and managing imitation, shaping the perimeter of the organization (i.e. defining or setting the limits of its scope) is the overarching mission of strategists.\nDecisions about diversification, outsourcing, vertical integration, internationalization and positioning, as well as defining new markets untainted by competition, are all linked with the search for a profitable perimeter.\nOf course, strategy is not limited to choices related to the organizational scope, but conversely any alteration of the perimeter can be considered as a strategic move.\n Most of the perimeter aspects are part of Corporate Strategy.\nThe DERE Model R. Grant (\u0026nbsp; [Grant06] \u0026nbsp;) underlines that a sound Strategy must \u0026ldquo;encompass consistency of direction, based upon a clear understanding of the game being played, a keen awareness of how to maneuver into a position of advantage and an effectively \u0026amp; faultless implementation\u0026rdquo;.\nThis would remain true for strategies that don’t exist as a plan, or even are not explicitly built.\n   Direction \n Strategy must be guided by a simple, consistent a long term, single-minded commitment to a clearly recognized goal that is pursued steadfastly over a substantial period of time.\n Johnson, Whittington \u0026amp; Scholes (\u0026nbsp; [Johnson11] \u0026nbsp;) insist that strategy is the long-term direction of a firm. „Strategy is the long term direction of an organization. [\u0026hellip;] The long term direction of Disney is from “Carton ” to diversified entertainment ”. As such it should include deliberate and logical strategy-making elements although it can also encompass more incremental and/or emergent patterns.\n  To A. Chandler or K. Andrews, two management and corporate strategy gurus, action plans do matter but only as a means of fulfilling long-term objectives, direction or goals. Strategy setting is therefore also about defining the purpose and/or (present or future) business of a company. It flows from the determination of goals to the allocation of resources.\nTo M. Porter, strategy is about positioning: making the deliberate choice of being and behaving differently.\n Environment \u0026amp; Resources \nFormulating a successful strategy requires more than direction. Defining a compelling strategy stems from a profound understanding of the competitive environment (\u0026ldquo;a deep and insightful appreciation of the arena in which the organization is competing \u0026rdquo;) and a non-complacent appraisal of one’s own resource (\u0026ldquo;exploiting internal strength, while protecting areas of weakness\u0026rdquo;).\n Execution \nWithout effective implementation (or strategy execution) the best-laid strategies are of little use.\n The effectiveness of leaders in reaching decisions is key to success, as well as, their energy in implementing them, their effectiveness in instilling loyalty \u0026amp; commitment among subordinates and allow effective marshaling of resources \u0026amp; capabilities and to build organizations that promptly respond to changes in the competitive environment. (\u0026nbsp; [Grant06] \u0026nbsp;) Preparing detailed analyses drawing up plans, making extensive slide presentations and holding long meetings might all be necessary means, but ultimately it is the organization\u0026rsquo;s action directed at the market-place that counts. (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  Strategy is about being different The essence of strategy is about being different and there are two ways a company can be different:\n   Deliver something Different: offer to customer something they can\u0026rsquo;t get elsewhere (and different here must not be confused with better - in other words differentiation is not restricted to higher-end differentiation).\n Do things Differently: find a different way to deliver the value propositions to customers. Configure the value architecture differently.\n Stay Focussed: to paraphrase M. Porter \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t try to be everything to everybody\u0026rdquo;. Be clear about what you do and equally clear about what you don\u0026rsquo;t do.\n    Strategizing Strategy Formulation The Art of Strategy can be seen as the assessment and alignment of four components:\n market opportunity: what the company might do,\n corporate competences \u0026amp; resources: what the company can do,\n Values \u0026amp; aspirations: what the company wants to do,\n Acknowledgment of obligations to society: what the company should do.\n  The strategic options that get implemented, result from matching opportunity and corporate capabilities, provides that they meet the aspiration of the firm at an acceptable level of corporate responsibility.\n   It is the unity, coherence and and internal consistency of a company\u0026rsquo;s strategic decisions that position the company in its environment and give the firm its identify, its power to mobilize its strengths, and its likelihood of success in the marketplace. - (\u0026nbsp; [Andrews87] \u0026nbsp;)  Reasons for not articulating strategy While the unity and the coherence of a firm\u0026rsquo;s strategy can be the result of a deliberate process corporate, it can also be the result of compromise among coalitions backing contrary policy proposals, unspoken consensus, or skillful improvisatory adaptation to external forces.\n \u0026ldquo;Conscious planning of the long-term development of companies has been until recently less common than individual executive responses to environmental pressure, competitive threat, or entrepreneurial opportunity\u0026rdquo;. (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  In that perspective, Strategy becomes unplanned, natural, intuitive, incremental by nature.\nA reason for the absence of a deliberate strategic plan can be \u0026ldquo;the desirability of keeping it confidential for security reasons and ambiguous to avoid internal conflict [\u0026hellip;] or to avoid resistance or hurting any emotional attachments\u0026rdquo;.\nFour interrelated facets Strategy as a practice encompasses four aspects or facets that are deeply interrelated:\n   Strategy Purpose, as stated by De Wit \u0026amp; Meyer, \u0026ldquo;Organisations exist to fulfill a purpose, and strategies are employed to ensure that the organisational pupose is realised and making strategies is not an end in itself but a means for reaching special objectives\u0026rdquo;.\n Strategy process, describes the set of activities, their sequencing as well as the roles and responsibilities of the involved stakeholders.\n Strategy content, corresponds to the output (or product) of the strategy process, i.e. a formulation of the expected strategy for the firm or a course of action for achieving the firm\u0026rsquo;s purpose.\n Strategy context, refers to the specific environment (within and outside the firm)in which the strategy process takes place.\n  The strategy process usually deeply depends on the specific context and purpose of a firm. Likewise, opting for a different process is likely to influence the strategy content.\nAnalysis, Formulation, Execution The strategy process is classically decomposed into three steps: the analysis, the formulation and the execution.\nWith the analysis phase, strategists seek to delineate and understand the situation. Next, in the formulation phase they look for strategic options, rank them and select one. Finally the selected option is implemented in the execution phase.\n  Strategy formation is usually depicted as a three-step process : analysis, formulation and execution. :\n Analysis – In a first step, both internal (self evaluation) and external environment must be appraised. The analysis should encompass both macro-environmental and micro-environmental (the industry, competitors, etc) considerations. It aims at gathering facts and figures but also at figuring out trends and possible evolutions. Identification refer to al the activities contributing to a better understanding of the issue what constitute an important opportunity or threat, which is linked to the firm\u0026rsquo;s mission. Most strategic issues are complex and getting some sort of understanding requires deliberate analyses. Looking at the the environment surrounding a firm is usually called an external assessment, while the internal assessment focuses on the capabilities and internal functioning of the firm.\n Formulation – When their landscape is known and understood, firms produce a clear set of recommendations (or strategic plan), with sup- porting justifications. Recommendations may propose to revise and/or update the missions, goals or objectives of the organization. It is usually considered that a good recommendation should be effective in solving the problem(s) while ensuring a good level of ’fit’ between the resources and competences and the external environment. It should also be feasible within a reasonable timeframe, reasonable budget and without overly disruption for the organization. And above all, it should be (made) acceptable to the various stakeholders in the organizations. Formulation is sometimes broken down into two aspects: option generation and selection.\n Option generation aims at identifying and articulating potential options or avenues to address the strategic issue.\n Option selection consists in choosing among candidate options\n  Execution – Once approved, a strategy must be effectively and consistently implemented by the organization. Lack of sustainable and consistent commitment is one of the major pitfalls in strategy execution and probably the first reason for strategy implementation failures.\n  Strategy Elaboration is also a \u0026lsquo;Social Process\u0026rsquo; The Strategy Process is often assumed to be linear (things are done sequentially) rational (based on rigorous logic and extensive knowledge) and comprehensive (every thing can be changed at execution time).\nIn practice however, the three steps are not as sequential as depicted by the usual ’standard process’. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to proceed by successive iterations (a bit of analysis, a bit of formulation, then back to analysis and formulation, etc). \u0026ldquo;Strategies are formed incrementally, as organizations think and act in small iterative steps, letting strategies emerge as they go along.\u0026ldquo;(\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;) .\nHowever many academics and most practitioners now consider that the strategy process is more intuitive \u0026amp; creative than purely rational. \u0026ldquo;Strategizing is about perceiving and envisioning and imagination \u0026amp; judgment are more important than analysis and logic\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;) .\nWhile it can occur, it is also rather rare that a company can fully redesign. \u0026ldquo;Strategy changes is usually more gradual and fragmented than radical and coordinated\u0026rdquo;.\n   Iteration – Conducting a comprehensive analysis before stepping to the formulation stage would be very time consuming and probably inefficient. Usually firms run successive analysis-formulation loops. Candidate strategic moves are identified (formulated) further to a first analysis. Then subsequent analysis-formulation loops are handled, to refine the candidate projects and eliminate some. When projects are considered sufficiently robust and justified, a final recommendation is made to decision makers.\n Buy-In – Strategic recommendations usually challenge the status quo and propose to walk out from the established comfort zone. Experience shows that when strategic recommendations are established in isolation from the rest of a firm, they are likely to be (at least at first) rejected by internal stakeholders. Strategists must therefore, leave their ivory tower and make sure that some stakeholders representing the various firm’s Functions (or departments) get involved and familiar with the analysis and formulation as soon as possible. However, internal stakeholders can be very complacent with the current situation and/or extremely reluctant when it comes to breakthrough changes. Strategists may choose to perform some analyses alone (or possibly with external support) to avoid distortions. These results can then be shared with other internal stakeholders to raise their awareness.\n Explain – Once established, a strategic recommendation must be explained first to the decision makers, then to internal stakeholders (to get it executed) and also to external stakeholders (customers, suppliers, media, shareholders, rating agencies, etc). It is paramount to make it very simple, comprehensible and as crisp as possible. If you cannot articulate your strategy in a one-minute elevator ride, or put it in a single piece of paper (with no buzzword, no techno-geek stuff and no implicit statement) it is likely that strategy will never get executed.\n Story telling – Story telling is inherent to strategic move. It is always a good sign when co-workers and/or external analysts start to ’recite’ the story. However, it would be a mistake to reduce strategy formulation to the production of catch phrases or tag lines. It is not straightforward to craft a simple, compelling story. It is usually the result of a comprehensive and deep strategic analysis.\n Feedback – Last but not least, it is always useful to ensure explicit feedback between execution (the strategy that get actually implemented) and formulation (the intended strategy) to control effectiveness. Discrepancies between the two can reflect changes (in the external and or internal environment), which would require adjusting the strategy formulation. It may also be the sign that the intended strategy is not rightly implemented, which also require revisiting the strategy formulation to make sure it is better understood and executed.\n  Strategy elaboration is also a social process, in so that the involvement and support of all stakeholders must be explicitly built as part of the elaboration of strategy..\n The main tensions in the strategy process are summarized here-below\n         Strategic Thinking Rational vs intuitive \u0026amp; creative thinking   Strategy Formation Intended vs Emergent strategy   Evolution \u0026amp; Change Radical vs Incremental redesign    Strategy thinking and cognition Strategizing involves two nature of mental activities: defining strategic problems and solving strategic problems which broadly cover the following aspects:\n Identification sense-making of the situation or problem\n Diagnosis understand the structure of the problem and its underlying cause\n Formulation derive potential solutions and select the preferred one.\n Realise undertake concrete actions to achieve the expected result(s).\n  De Wit stresses that for some scholars strategic reasoning is dominantly a logical activity that hinge upon strong analytical skills. The course of action is explicitly derived from an in-depth analysis of the facts and available data. However despite their seeking to be comprehensive, rigorous and systematic, strategists will hit some shortcomings and cognitive limitations. As stressed by H. Simon \u0026ldquo;people act intentionally rational but only limitedly so\u0026rdquo; (\u0026nbsp; [Simon57] \u0026nbsp;) \u0026ldquo;.\nOther thinkers are strong proponents of generative reasoning: creating new perspective, unveiling new insights and find new ways to solve problems. According to them \u0026ldquo;Creative thinking should be the driving force and logical thinking a supporting means\u0026rdquo;. Defining and solving strategic problem is primarily a creative activity: questions are ill-defined \u0026amp; highly subjectives and furthermore, the classes of potential solutions are not known in advance (aka wicked problem (\u0026nbsp; [Ritel73] \u0026nbsp;) ).\nArticulating a strategy then becomes a creative reformulation of the situation. For instance Jim Kecinski (Managing director at Google) stresses that one should \u0026ldquo;tap into the wisdom of crowds to drive innovation and creativity\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;framebreaking ideas can\u0026rsquo;t be found, they have to be generated\u0026rdquo;. Sergey Brin (Google\u0026rsquo;s co-founder) considers that most successful projects at Google have emerged bottom-up rather than being conceived top-down.\nStrategic Change The alignment of firms with their environment is a dynamic balance. It constantly evolves and firms have to change to stay alive.\n While change is pervasive, not all change in firms is strategic in nature. Much of the change witnessed is actually the operational kind (i.e. directed at increasing the performance of the firm within the confines of the existing system) (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)    Strategic changes (aka Strategic renewal) have an impact on how a company makes business and/or on how it configures its capabilities. Strategic renewal can be characterized by the magnitude of change (incremental vs step change) and by the pace of change (continuous \u0026amp; evolutionary vs. abrupt \u0026amp; radical).\n to achieve strategic renewal it is essential to turn away from the firm\u0026rsquo;s heritage and to start with a clean slate. On the other hand, to achieve lasting strategic renewal, people in the organisation need time to learn, adapt and grow , building on past experiences, investments and loyalties. (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  Big bang approaches (radical and disruptive) may be necessary when organizational rigidity is so deep that small increments can create the momentum and move the needle.\nFirms are complex systems. The business system refers to the way \u0026lsquo;a firm makes money\u0026lsquo;: it is a configuration of inputs, outputs (value proposition) and activities (thoughput) intended to create value for customers.\nThe organisational system refers to \u0026lsquo;the way a firm carries out the business\u0026rsquo; (i.e. how the individuals populating the firm have been configured and relate to one another, with the intention of facilitating the business system.)\nThe organisation system is often further decomposed into its structure (anatomy), its processes (physiology) and its culture (pyschology) (\u0026nbsp; [Bartlett] \u0026nbsp;) .\nThe organisation structure depicts how the organisation is configured in smaller parts and reflects the division of labour (i.e. how to deliver value effectively and efficiently). The structure of an organisation can hinge on its inputs (e.g. structured by core inputs or supply-chain channels), its transformation processes (e.g. structured by nature of value-adding activities, transformation technologies, locations) or its outputs (e.g. by groups of clients, by product-markets, by brands, by distribution channels).\nThe organisational processes depict the arrangements, procedures, and mechanisms used to control and coordinate the various people and sub-structures. Processes can span the full organisation of by contrast, remain very local to some activities. Not all processes are formalized, and very often there is a full set of implicit processes and routines alongside formal processes.\nThe organisation culture corresponds to behavioural patterns shared by the members of an organisation. It includes values and norms, which play as a common interpretative filter of the surrounding environment.\n Culture can act as a strong integration mechanism, controlling and coordinating people\u0026rsquo;s behaviour, by getting them abide by \u0026lsquo;the way we do things around here\u0026rsquo;. (\u0026nbsp; [DeWit10] \u0026nbsp;)  Some sort of integration mechanism is needed to balance the horizontal differentiation of tasks. The formal authority (hierarchy) is one of those.\n"

	"content": " First, consider the \"W\" It is usually wise to make sure that the Why, for Whom, What, by When and with Whom are sufficiently understood before attempting to defining the How. It is therefore paramount to explicit all the facets of the ”problem” before trying to solve it.\n   Problem Statement - (mis-)understanding or (mis-)stating the problem (why do we need to formulate a strategy, why now, about what precisely, etc..) is often the Achilles’ heel of strategy-making. As initially presented (ex-ante statement) many aspects of the problem can be implicit or even unsuspected. Delineating accurately the problem to be solved is the best way to find how to rightly solve it. This cannot always be fully achieved during initial planning. In that case, activities to refine the problem-statement must be planned.\n Decision makers - knowing who the decision makers are, what they expect from the project, what they already believe or (think they) know is also absolutely essential. Getting direct access to the ’sponsors’ of the project and checking their expectation is preferable although not always feasible. It doesn’t necessarily imply that the formulation should confirm their convictions. Nevertheless, it is wise to be aware in advance, if the recommendations won’t fit their beliefs.\n Deliverables - identifying beforehand, what are the artifacts to be produced is also absolutely key for planning. As already mentioned several types of artifacts must be considered and not all of them are intended for final presentation. Notwithstanding that, visualizing the final deliverable(s) helps calibrating the strategy formulation project, identifying the contributors and the level of effort.\n Timeline - agreeing with the project sponsors on the project timeline is also absolutely necessary. More than getting absolute dates, it is crucial to know if the strategy formulation project must get synchronized with other events (e.g. strategic planning process, board meeting, etc). It is noteworthy that in strategy elaboration, deadlines tend to shift \u0026ldquo;to the left\u0026rdquo; and delays to shorten. That can be an issue with purely sequential methods and it is one of the reasons why more iterative approaches (series of successive refinement loops) are often advisable.\n Stakeholders - last but not least, it is fundamental to detect who holds stakes in the project. Identifying the contributors to a strategy elaboration is a by-product of project planning. Nevertheless, additional people must usually also get involved to ensure success and smooth the buy-in of the recommendations. These persons must be identified very early, and the way they will interact with strategy elaboration (e.g. interviews, workshops, reviews, etc.) must be carefully planned.\n  Defining the How There are many approaches to strategic elaboration, but they all include some sort of evaluation of the current situation (analysis, diagnosis), identification of the target state(s) (future, ideal state or position) and definition of a route from current situation to future expected state.\n  This is often summarized by the three following questions:\n  Situation Where are we today? What is our current state? Target Where do we want to be in the future? What is our target ? Path What route(s) can lead us from our current situation to target?   There are basically two categories of methods:\n Start from the current situation - first establish a comprehensive picture of the current situation of the firm and its environment. Answer thoroughly the question ”where are we today?” and from there, tackle the question ”where can/shall we go tomorrow?”. These methods implicitly suggest that an acute and accurate analysis of the current situation can reveal the precise strategic goal that the firm should pursue and the best path to get there. To some extend, these methods insinuate that the best strategic move is fully determined by a given situation. Hence, the role of the strategist would be to read from the internal \u0026amp; external environment (like fortune-tellers can predict destiny from cards).\n Start from the candidate target state(s) - start from drawing an image of the ideal desired state(s), before mapping a possible route from the current situation toward the target to which the firm is aspiring. First address the question ”where would we like, ideally, to be tomorrow?” and then work out a path to that target, considering the gap from today’s situation. Much room is left for intuition and strategic leaps. However, the ”ideal target” may seem to come out-of-the-blue and is usually more an input to than and out- come of the analysis. Yet, these methods are well suited to optimize and refined an already potential strategic moves.\n  Different methods and approaches can be blended, so to leverage their benefits and compensate their shortcomings. That is an additional reason for planning: the right combination of tools and methods depends upon the problem to be solved. Generally speaking, one can take full advantage of forward analysis methods to scan and identify candidate targets. Then backward reasoning methods can be used to refine and dispute the validity of the candidate targets.\n"

	"content": " Corporate Strategy aims at finding out how a company better Exploit and Enhance its capabilities.\n  For the purpose of corporate strategy formulation, resources can be thought as being of two kinds:\n Front-end resources are visible from end-customers and are made tangible in the value proposition (e.g. stores, layout, etc). By extension front-end capabilities also include capabilities that directly deals with customers (e.g. market forecast, market development, marketing, etc.)\n Back-end resources are outside customers’ view and are more associated to production technologies (value architecture : e.g. plants, machinery, patents). Back-end capabilities also encompass lean management, information systems, etc.\n  Let’s illustrate the exploit/enhance and back/front-end on Amazon’s case.\nExploiting Existing Front-end resources In 1998 Amazon bought the English bookseller BookPages and the German book-seller ABC. The two companies became amazon.uk and amazon.de respectively. These two acquisitions allowed Amazon to exploit its existing resources while generating additional value through market coverage extension.\nIn 2000 Amazon created virtual market place (and offered to its customers to buy additional products supplied by third parties). This move also mainly corresponded to exploiting existing front-end resources (the web interface to customers and associated relationship management).\n  Exploiting Existing Back-end resources As Amazon developed its main business (on-line shopping) they acquired significant skills and competence in IT systems (web technologies, web servers, infrastructure). Initially all these capabilities were needed to support the main line of business.\nIn 2006 they decided to exploit their existing back-end capabilities and make their IT a business. With?Amazon Web Services? they offer a comprehensive collection of online services (cloud computing, networking, storage and content delivery, database, online-payment, analytics, \u0026hellip;) for other web sites or client- side applications and are now one of the major players in cloud computing\nIt seems that they are replicating the model and are now eager to offer sup- ply logistics services (warehousing, order fulfillment) as well as probably parcel delivery (although their attempt to acquire 100% of the French shipping Colis Privé up from 25% was cancelled for antitrust issues). Amazon owns and ope- rates warehouses and distribution centers all over the world as well as its own fleet of trucks and aircraft (on lease). Analysts stress that „Amazon has an advantage in the market by managing the logistics of its own core revenue-generating business, then extending that capacity as a service to other companies”. The advantage is actually twofold as it both generates extra revenues and contributes to improve the cost structure of their core business\nEnhance Back-End Services Amazon also grew its back-end capacity, for instance when they acquired PlanetAll and Jungle to provide better customer experience (personal information manager, reminder capabilities, advanced browsing features). These capabilities supported the shift from book only toward more diversified product portfolio.\nIn 2012 Amazon also acquired Kiva Systems – and its breakthrough robotic technology for inventory management – for $ 775 million. Kiva was renamed to Amazon Robotics in 2015 and their products are no longer on offer on the market. By contrast, Amazon is now encouraging prospective users of Kiva technology to outsource their fulfillment process to Amazon robotics and Amazon Services within Amazon warehouses.\nEnhance Front-End Services When Amazon brought Kindle to the market, it enhanced it Front-End capabilities. As they realize that electronic books would represent a significant portion of their sales in the future, they also acquired Mobipocket (2005) a book producer and Brillance (2007) and audio-book producer.\n  Amazon is creating value across several industries. Founder Jeff Bezos has publicly referred to the Amazon.com mission statement 1 as the guiding force behind his leadership decisions many times in the company’s history.\n"

	"content": " The Ansoff\u0026rsquo;s Matrix The famous Ansoff’s matrix was first published in 1957 in the Harvard Business Review. It portrays the four alternative growth strategies, by considering existing products vs. new products, and existing markets vs. new markets.\n  Market penetration consists in increasing the business through offering the same product/service to the same market. Market development and Product development are sometimes called related diversification (or adjacent diversification). The idea here is to either offer new products to existing customers or to propose existing products to new markets. Product development is the most challenging option.\nMarket Penetration With Market Penetration, the firm seeks to achieve growth with existing products / services in their current market segments, aiming to increase its market share. It is the least risky strategy since it leverages many of the firm’s existing resources and it requires no change in strategic capabilities\nIn a growing market, simply maintaining market share will result in growth, and there may exist opportunities to increase market share if competitors reach capacity limits. Usually more business volume translates into some cost efficiency. However, market penetration has limits, and once the market approaches saturation another strategy must be pursued if the firm is to continue to grow.\nThere are two major downsides to Market Penetration:\n Retaliation from competitors rivalry among competitors is likely to get exacerbated, especially in mature markets. Market penetration in low- growth markets often triggers horizontal integration and consolidation (one of the player seeks to acquire its competitors).\n Legal constraints Anti trust regulations aims at limiting market power. Therefore authorities are likely to prevent consolidation beyond a certain limit.\n  Note: Retrenchment (a firm deciding to withdraw from a less attractive market) is the opposite to market penetration.\nProduct Development With Product Development the firm develops new products and/or services – i.e. with different technologies – targeted to its existing market segments.\nA product development strategy may be appropriate if the firm’s strengths are related to its specific customers rather than to the specific product itself (i.e. customer bonding, customer relationship, available customer data, \u0026hellip;). In this situation, the company can leverage its strengths by developing a new product /service targeted to its existing customers.\nDepending on the degree of relatedness, Product Development may imply acquiring/developing new strategic capabilities (e.g. new processes, new technologies, new know how, etc). Therefore it usually carries more risk (e.g. delays, cost overruns, failure) than simply attempting to increase market share.\nMarket development With Market Development the firm seeks growth by targeting its existing products to new market segments.\nMarket development options include the pursuit of additional market segments (e.g. addressing additional user needs) or geographical regions (including internationalization).\nThe development of new markets for the product may be a good strategy if the firm’s core competencies are related more to the specific product than to its experience with a specific market segment. Because the firm is expanding into a new market, a market development strategy typically has more risk than a market penetration strategy.\nDiversification With Diversification the firm grows by diversifying into new businesses by developing new products for new markets.\nDiversification is the most risky of the four growth strategies since it requires both product and market development and may be outside the core competencies of the firm. However, diversification may be a reasonable choice if the high risk is compensated by the chance of a high rate of return.\nOther advantages of diversification include the potential to gain a foothold in an attractive industry and the reduction of overall business portfolio risk.\nDiversification can occur at business level (expanding to new segments of the industry) or at corporate level (entering new businesses out of the scope of current activities). Differentiating diversification from market development or product development can be however rather subjective, as it depends on the way “new product” and “new market” are interpreted.\nIt is usually considered that there is diversification when and if a firms tries to develop a new strategic segment, which usually requires new capabilities. Although diversification can be accessible through pure organic growth (developing existing resources \u0026amp; competence), it is often associated with external growth and, in that case usually requires Mergers \u0026amp; Acquisitions and/or Alliances.\n"

	"content": " Even when it is explicitly formulated, a strategy does include detailed actions for all stakeholders. On the contrary, it should focus on top level considerations and ensure alignment, while leaving a lot of freeway to the people in charge of executing.\n  Organization alignment D. Sull \u0026amp; K.M. Eisenhardt (\u0026nbsp; [Sull15] \u0026nbsp;) have rightly pointed out that if an organization’s strategy lives on the shelf then this organization has a problem. How to bridge the gap between strategy and execution? According to them, by polishing simple statements that help making on-the-spot decisions and adapting to rapidly changing circumstances\nIndeed, they argue that while a checklist or any other process adherence technique is usually well adapted in repetitive situation (e.g. safety control) to ensure the activities alignment with corporate objectives. Agreeing on a simple ’principle’ is more adequate in more dynamic environment however, where flexibility is important. Process operators can then decide the most appropriate action to cope with the principle, subject to the actual circumstances.\nIn A.C. Hax’s words the true purpose [of the strategy statement] is to capture and clearly articulate our intent. Strategy is a fundamental vehicle to communicate our sense of direction, both inside and outside the organization. It aims to give purpose and direction to an organization and end up with the proper implementation of a well-designed strategy.\nThis simple idea of not trying to fix in advance every tiny detail was made famous by D. Eisenhower who claimed No plan survive the first contact with the enemy.\n  Chip \u0026amp; Dan Heath (\u0026nbsp; [Heath07] \u0026nbsp;) hammer on the message. The planning process forces people to think through the right issues, however even if you may start off trying to fight your plan, the enemy gets a vote.\nIn the 80’s the Army invented the concept of CI (Commander’s intend): a crisp, plain-talk statement, specifying the goal, the desired end-state. You can lose the ability to execute the original plan but you never lose the responsibility of executing the CI.\nThe commander’s intend should phrase something like if we do nothing else, we must : xxx or something like the single most important thing is: xx.\nCompelling stories \u0026amp; Catch phrases The hard part in producing such a statement is weeding out ideas that are important but not the most important. Finding the core is about discarding a lot of insights to let shine the most important insight. Consistently repeating a simple statement (or intent) is the best way to ensure that all the stakeholders in the organization receive the message and then make appropriate decisions.\nChip \u0026amp; Dan Heath quote this story from Herb Kelleher, the CEO of SouthWest : *„Tracy from marketing comes into my office and she says that surveys show that the passengers might enjoy a Cesar salad on the Houston to Las Vegas flight. What do you answer? You respond: Tracy, will adding that chicken salad make us THE low-cost airline from Houston to Vegas? Because if it doesn’t help us become the unchallenged low-cost airline, then we’re not serving any damn chicken salad.*” (Southwest’s CEO)\nNo one knows if there ever existed a Tracy in Southwest Marketing, but the story drives the point home: Southwest is THE low-cost company. Southwest has been very consistent in its intent over the years and has also been one of the only consistently profitable airline for more than 30 years.\n  Telling stories is also a way to make sure the staff can remember and feel the purpose of a strategic move. According to J. Conger (\u0026nbsp; [Conger08] \u0026nbsp;) Herb Kelleher used to tell the following story when visiting his operations across the United States: „It’s funny, I get letters all the time from shareholders and they’re often angry letters. They say : ’American West is flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for $149 one way. And you, Herb Kelleher at Southwest, are pricing $79 for that same one-way ticket. Don’t you have the decency to at least kick your price up to $129 ? Why are you leaving so much on the table ?’ Well, what I do is write and reply : Thank you so much for your letter. However you don’t understand who we are, and you really don’t understand who our competition is. It’s automobile; it’s not other airlines. And $79 is the price to drive, including maintenance, insurance and gasoline, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. That’s how we price or ticket. ” (Southwest’s CEO)\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " A Value proposition is the description of the offer (product or service) made by a company to its customer and why the offer is attractive to customers.\n One of the central questions in Strategy is: which value proposition should be developed? to serve which customer segments?\n   Value Propositions compete with a broad set of substitutes. Customers, through their behaviors and consumption logic, determine which companies are actually competing.\nHence it is crucial not to start any strategic analysis with an a priori definition of strategic groups. By contrast, it is key to look at actual trade-offs made by customers and understand how their choices depends on the emotional value and usefulness they perceive in products.\nFirms compete  with each other in product markets to the extent that they may attract the same customer and serve similar needs.\n Potential substitutes and new entrants are often the highest competitive threats but also the most challenging to foresee. They are usually the ones who cause the break in the sector and can profoundly change established rules of the game.\n As stressed by Peteraf and Bergen ( [Peteraf03] ) „The identification of the originality of the offer in terms of value delivered to the customer is at the heart of the definition of a business model specific to a company. The identification of rivals in the satisfaction of the same need of the customer is an essential task for the configuration of an innovative business model.”\n Customers When dealing with Business Models, the word Customer must be understood in its broadest sense. Theoretically, any stakeholder who interacts with the product or plays a role in the purchase decision, should be considered a Customer.\nIn their MOOC (\u0026nbsp; [Lehmann-Ortega15] \u0026nbsp;) L. Lehmannn-Ortega and Hélène Musikas develop the example of an insulin pen that generates value for patients (who use it) for doctors (who prescribe it), for pharmacists (who sell it) for Care givers (health care staff, family members, who can spend more time with patients and less on technical aspects). The list could be extended as well to Health Care Insurance companies and the Health Care Authorities.\n  Customer roles will typically include:\n Users - or consumers - will gain benefit from actually using the product or service. For instance in the Air Transport system, passengers are usually the users of aircraft (although pilots, cabin crew and mechanics would as well be a different kind of users).\n Recommenders - can advise or suggest specific products or services. For some products (e.g. medical treatment prescription) recommenders can select the product for users.\n Opinion leaders - don’t necessarily interact directly with users or decision-makers, but their opinion can significantly influence the decision to buy or not to buy. With the advent of the social web, any potential user can as well become an opinion leader / influencer for other customers.\n Buyers - paying customers will handle the economic transaction and will usually pay for the product or service.\n Decision-Makers - select the product or service. For B2C (Business to Consumers) businesses, the Decision Maker is often also the Buyer and the User. This is usually not the case for B2B (Business to Business) businesses.\n     „In the past 50 years, the average business model lifespan has fallen from about 15 years to less than 5. Business model innovation is thus no longer one of many ways to gain a competitive edge, but it is a necessary core capability to respond to – and capitalize on – a changing world.” [BCG]\n It is therefore crucial to clearly identify all the stakeholders (potential customers) and understand their motivations to accept or reject a value proposition.\nMany Business Model innovations draw from the decoupling of the various customer roles (i.e. the using customers vs the paying customers).\n What Job do you hire the product for ? Clayton Christensen (\u0026nbsp; [Christensen07] \u0026nbsp;) proposes a specific framework to help identify customer expectations and competitive arenas. In the original article and also in many videos available on the Internet, the concept is illustrated with the story of a fast-food restaurant that was seeking to improve the sales of its milkshake sales.\n  The restaurant had done a lot of data crunching and segmented its market both by product (milkshakes) and by demographics (attributes of milkshake drinkers). They also had run focus groups where they asked to representative customers what they would fancy. Despite all these quantitative and qualitative data gathering, the restaurant hadn’t substantially improved its sales.\nThe restaurant then enlisted a team of researchers from Clayton Christensen’s lab. They approached the topic by raising the question:\n “What job arises in people’s life that causes them to come to this restaurant to hire a milkshake?”.\n   On the first day they stood in the restaurant for several hours, recording very detailed facts about customers: were they coming alone or in group, what time did they get to the restaurant, did they buy other food, did they eat it in the restaurant or drive off with it, etc. It turned out that half of the milkshakes were sold before 8 am, to people always alone, it was the only thing they bought and they drove off with it immediately.\nOn the second day the researchers interviewed these specific customers and discovered that they all had a lot and boring drive to work and they had to do something to keep the commuting interesting.\nThe restaurant was in fact facing two categories of customers and was therefore playing in two distinct competitive arenas. In the morning it was facing commuters and in the afternoon parents with Children. The two categories of customers had very different expectations and were ”hiring milkshakes” for completely different jobs.\n  We often wrongly assume that we know right away in which industry we compete. However, the competitive arena(s) in which you are competing can only be unveiled by really scrutinizing the job the customer is hiring you to do.\n Once you have clearly figured out what jobs customers are hiring you to do, you can more easily identify:\n which customers and buyers are you targetting ? (i.e. who can benefit from the job your product can do)\n who your suppliers should be?\n who your competitors are or might be ? (i.e. who else can do identical job)\n who might be potential entrants / substitutes? (i.e. who may do similar jobs)\n  Pricing For a given type of needs there might exist many different value propositions. A common way of comparison is to draw them along two axes: customer perceived value and price. While many combinations are possible, five distinct areas can be spotted.\n   Reference Offer - when a market is mature enough there will be a value proposition (or range of value propositions) that is considered the reference offer both for its price and its (perceived) value. Any other proposition will be compared against this reference point.\nIn a nascent market, the reference offer is usually the first entrant. In case of market shake-up the reference can be the products that are being substituted. Sometimes, the reference offer only exists in customers’ mind (e.g. as an average offer).\n Non Viable zone - any value proposition that would yield less value than the reference offer but at a higher price would obviously be disregarded by customers - who would accept to pay more for less? Likewise, at any requested price, any offer that doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring enough value (relatively to other VPs) is considered as non viable.\n Price discount a first differentiating option is to offer similar value (compared to the reference offer) at lower price. This option to be viable for the firm requires that the firm can deliver the same value for less cost, hence the name of Cost Leadership. When several players are capable of delivering this option it usually becomes the new reference offer (and the former reference point becomes non viable).\n Low-end differentiation less value is offered at a discount compared to the reference offer. Such value propositions would not appeal to all customers but it can be viable if some customers are ready to trade product attributes against a price discount. Low Cost Carriers in Aviation are typically offering less services at a cheaper price.\n High-end differentiation this is the opposite approach. New features are included to the product for a higher price. Building on the same example a first class airline ticket offer more comfort but is significantly more expensive than economic class.\n Game Changing is a position that provides both a price discount and value increase (at least for some customer segments). When a game changing value proposition is introduced, it is likely to supplant the existing reference offer and quickly become the new reference point.\n  Bowman\u0026rsquo;s Strategy Clock The Strategy Clock (\u0026nbsp; [Bowman97] \u0026nbsp;) is an other model that explores the various value/price positions.\nIn its simplest version, it stresses tree areas: i) cost leadership strategies that allows for different combinations of lower price at lower perceived value, ii) differentiation strategies with above average value proposition at a premium, iii) non-competitive strategies that are non-viable and iv) hybrid strategies with both above average features and cheaper price.\nIt is noteworthy that with this model, differentiation means more value.\n   At 12 o\u0026rsquo;clock - Differentiation without any price premium - corresponds to a highly differentiated product/service (highest perceived value) that is offered at parity price. This position can usually not be sustained in the long run (especially not if higher costs are implied) but still can be chosen as a market entry strategy to quickly gain market shares (more features at no extra cost)\n At one o’clock - Differentiation with price premium - represents the typical differentiation strategy where a higher perceived value translates into higher prices.\n At 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock - Some differentiation with high premium - this is likely to soon become some sort of focussed differentiation (i.e. targeting a customer segment with specific customer needs / addressing an area with little competition). Although the perceived value by the average customer is close to parity, the specifically targeted segment see far more value (e.g. there is one feature that is of no use for the average customer but key for the targeted customer) and is therefore willing to pay more.\n 3 o\u0026rsquo;clock to 6 o\u0026rsquo;clock non-viable positions\n 7 o\u0026rsquo;clock - Low price with lower value - This is the typical no-frills strategy (e.g. low cost airlines) where a company downgrades the product attributes, hence both the perceived value and production costs.\n 9 o\u0026rsquo;clock - Low price at product parity - this generic cost leadership strategy combines lower price and reasonable perceived value (compared to the average competitor). In this position a company would drive its costs to the bare minimum and balance very low margins with high volume. A well-installed cost leader can sustain this approach. However there is a risk that prices become unstable and that a price war breaks out, which would i) benefit consumers only, ii) destroy company value and iii) usually lead to industry consolidation\n 10 - 11 o\u0026rsquo;clock - Lower price and higher value - This zone allows for major changes: strategies that both involve low price and some differentiation. The perceived value (at least for some product attributes and some customer groups) is above average while price are still below average. A hybrid strategy can be chosen by a company wishing to enter a new market (product segment, export) or to speed-up market penetration and create customer lock-in effect (e.g. proprietary standard). Some companies can sustain hybrid strategies over a long period of time. Furniture store IKEA, for instance, combines economy of scale, no frills (DIY, no delivery, etc) and differentiated design.\n  Challenging the reference value proposition In any market, the value proposition offered by the larger bulk of firms (dominant strategic group) is the reference and other strategic groups need to differentiate from that standard.\n Improvement better value proposition for the market as a whole, which shifts the reference value proposition.\n Specialisation value proposition specifically targeted to a dedicated market segment (specific needs e.g. extra-large size in the clothing industry).\n Streamline offer a simplified product/service at lower costs.\n Limitation low cost offer dedicated to a specific market segment.\n  The issue with the limitation/streamline approaches is one must ensure that i) there is a sufficient creditworthy market and ii) the value proposition is not too far from the reference offer.\nComplements Value Proposition Design Framework The value proposition design framework (\u0026nbsp; [Osterwalder12] \u0026nbsp;) aims at defining in a more structured way the most adequate value proposition.\n  Please note that this section is deeply inspired from the web site Business Model Alchemist .\n\u0026nbsp;\nIdentify customers and the needs they are seeking to satisfy\nThe first step consists in identifying customers or potential customers.\nFrom there, one should seek to identify what the targeted customers are trying to achieve, what are the problem they are trying to solve (aka customer\u0026rsquo;s jobs), the needs they are trying to satisfy. It is noteworthy that needs may not be only functional (i.e. complete a specific task) but can also be social (e.g. status, power, belonging) and emotional (e.g. aesthetics, security, \u0026hellip;).\nOnce needs are clarified, one should consider all potential sources of pains (i.e. negative emotions, frustrations, costs, risks, inconvenience, discomfort, under-performance) that are experienced by the customers before, during and after getting their need satisfied.\nLikewise, one should identify all the features and benefits that customers expect, desire or would be thrilled by. Again this is not limited to functional aspects but may cover as well social gains, positive emotions, cost-time-effort savings. Existing products and solutions are likely to already address some aspects (but probably not all or not for all customers).\n Design a Value proposition \nThe value proposition is the response to a customer need. It may encompass product and services (tangible good, one-to-one customer facing service, on-line interaction, branding and other intangible aspects, financing services, etc).\nOnce the pains are clearly identified, it is easier to check how the value proposition alleviate these pains and how much pains are eliminated. Likewise, it is easy to underline which customer expectations are addressed by the value proposition and what specific benefit (possibly compared to what competitors do) is brought.\nC. Christensen (\u0026nbsp; [Christensen08] \u0026nbsp;) stresses four aspects that should be considered in priority to unveil untapped market spaces:\n Wealth barriers sometimes customers don’t have enough revenues to afford existing value propositions. When Tata looked at creating a new car for Indian domestic market, they knew they had to compete with US$ 2500 scooters. The size of the Indian market allows for rebalancing the profit equation through volume.\n Skill barriers customers don’t always have the knowledge, technical background or competence to use mainstream solutions. This is particularly true in Business to Business segments where the solutions targeted at SMEs are different from the solutions used by large corporations.\n Time barriers mail-order selling and more recently internet-based shopping have grown as consumers get aware of the time required to shop in physical stores in city centers or shopping malls.\n Access barriers some form of asymmetry of information may make the service and / or product difficult to find and access. For example, independent consultants are usually barely visible outside their close network. A bypass strategy can consist in relying upon a business ecosystem that is sufficient to leverage the value proposition.\n    Disruptive innovation The term disruptive innovation was coined by Clayton Christensen who provided an explanation for the failure of well-respected companies and the appearance of new value propositions / players (\u0026nbsp; [Christensen97] [Christensen00] [Christensen03] [Christensen04] \u0026nbsp;)  „few academic management theories have had as much influence in the business world as Clayton M. Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation.” (\u0026nbsp; [King15] \u0026nbsp;)  Christensen notes that when a company tries to satisfy its existing customer base, it usually focuses on improving its current product/service offering and will typically add more features or increase performance. More often than not, the value proposition will overshoot customers’ expectation and soon become\n „ too sophisticated, too expensive, and too complicated for many customers in their market” [claytonchristensen.com]\n Christensen stresses that companies pursue product/service improvement at the higher tiers of their markets because this is what has historically helped them succeed:\n „by charging the highest prices to their most demanding and sophisticated customers at the top of the market, companies will achieve the greatest profitability” (Christensen).\n This however paves the way to disruptive innovations: a newer technology making its appearance in the background, serving primary needs in a better / more convenient way and allowing consumers at the bottom of a market access to a product or service that was historically only accessible to consumers with a lot of money or a lot of skill.\n „Characteristics of disruptive businesses, at least in their initial stages, can include : lower gross margins, smaller target markets, and simpler products and services that may not appear as attractive as existing solutions when compared against traditional performance metrics. Because these lower tiers of the market offer lower gross margins, they are unattractive to other firms moving upward in the market, creating space at the bottom of the market for new disruptive competitors to emerge.” (Christensen)\n In many industries, technologies improve faster than customer demands of those technologies increase. „The overlooked, underserved and seemingly unprofitable end of the market [CPU for personal computer less than $1000 in 1998] can provide fertile ground for massive competitive change.” (Andy Groove, former CEO of Intel) Time after time and industry after industry, „once the disruptive product gains a foothold in new or low-end markets, the disruptors are on a path that will ultimately crush the incumbents” ([Christensen, 2003]).\nIn a nutshell\n A disruptive innovation initially offers a lower performance according to what the mainstream market historically demanded, The new product/service is more convenient can serve a new demand As it improves along the traditional performance attributes, it eventually displaces the incumbent technology  Disruptive innovations are all the more effective if they can create a negative experience effect and penalize the dominant companies operating according to the business model in force. Leaders will suddenly be at a competitive disadvantage because of the very practices that have been successful in the past. The reaction therefore requires a twofold effort : learning the new rules of the game and dis-learning traditional practices ([Grandval and Ronteau, 2011]).\n „not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the first automobiles in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in 1908. The mass-produced automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not” (wikipedia).\n "

	"content": " On the fringe of the two dominant orthodox models (the market-based and resource-based theories) several frameworks have been introduced. They’ve not all made it through. However some frameworks (eg. Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim \u0026amp; Renée Mauborgne or Delta model by A. Hax) are becoming popular and are considered valid alternatives or at least good supplements to the dominant models.\n  In Hax\u0026rsquo;s words (\u0026nbsp; [Hax01] \u0026nbsp;) :\n „the most respected and popular strategy development frame- works have associated ’strategy’ with competitive advantage”\n As a result, the dominant orthodox models:\n put competitors and rivalry as the principal centre of attention, strategy is war, success is conceived as beating someone,\n are anchored in the past : the factors that did shape the current structure of the industry tend to be overestimated, which limits outside-the- box thinking prevents step changes,\n focus on competition and foster imitation: the attributes of our pro- ducts are inspired and copied from the market leaders, which sooner or later drives the convergence of the industry toward commoditization.\n  Focus on Customers Not on Competitors With Blue Ocean Strategy customers and not competitors should be the centre of attention:\n „using competitors as a benchmark leads to sameness and sameness will never lead us to greatness. By contrast, we should experiment and engage in a continuous learning process that propels us into uncharted territory ” ([Hax, 2001]).\n   The objective is no longer to obtain a competitive advantage vis-à-vis competitors, but to achieve customer bondings: to deeply understand customers, recognize their differences and create a value proposition that uniquely meet each customer’s needs.\nDiscovering uncontested Market Space According to W. Chan Kim \u0026amp; Renée Mauborgne (\u0026nbsp; [Mauborgne05] \u0026nbsp;) a firm can manage to both establish itself and become successful even in a declining industry, in an industry in which traditional strategic analysis would conclude to very limited potential growth. This can be achieved by creating an uncontested new market space that makes the competition irrelevant.\n „Red oceans will always be a fact of business life and will always matter. The ability to swim successfully in the red ocean and outcompete rivals will remain key for most players. However, to seize new profit and growth opportunities, company need to go beyond competing and to create blue oceans”. [Kim \u0026amp; Mauborgne]\n   Blue Ocean thinking encourages entrepreneurs and managers to be different by finding or creating market spaces that are not currently being served. Unveiling a Blue Strategy is not straightforward (it is a lot easier to explain ex-post why a strategic move actually unveiled a Blue Strategy). However, the Blue Ocean Strategic Canvas help develop strategies based on creating new market spaces\n  Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today (i.e. the known market place) whereas Blue Oceans denote all the industries not yet in existence today. Instead of focusing on beating competition, they focused on making competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and the company.\n In red oceans, industry boundaries are pre-defined and the competitive rules of the game are known: companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. Competition-based ’Red Ocean Strategy’ assumes that an industry’s structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them. Blue oceans in contrast, correspond to untapped market space, demand creation and the opportunity for highly profitable growth. Market boundaries \u0026amp; industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions \u0026amp; beliefs of industry players.\n Firms that create Blue Oceans seem to adopt different strategy logic. Instead of looking for better solutions to the problem, they redefine the problem itself. This is achieved by breaking market boundaries and the usual value-cost trade-off.\nValue innovation is created when a company affects both its cost structure and its value proposition to buyers. Buyer value is increased through creating elements the industry has never offered or raising some attributes of the existing offerings. Cost saving are made by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on.\nOver time costs are reduced even further as high sales volumes can drive economies of scale. Value innovation places equal emphasis on value and on innovation.\n Value w/o innovation tends to focus on value creation on an incremental scale (insufficient to make a company stand out in the market place). Innovation without value tends to be technology-driven, futuristic and often overshooting beyond what buyers are ready to accept and pay for.\n Value innovation occurs only when companies align innovation with utility, price and cost positions. If they fail to anchor innovation with value, technology innovators \u0026amp; market pioneers often lay the eggs that the other companies hatch.\nValue innovation defies the commonly accepted dogma that companies can either create greater value at a higher cost or create reasonable value at a lower cost. Strategy is seen as making a choice between differentiation and low cost. In contrast, Companies that seek to create Blue Oceans will pursue simultaneously differentiation and low cost.\nReveal: factor that are taken for granted The first step of the Blue Ocean Strategic Canvas aims to reveal what are the factors that the industry takes for granted (i.e. that are implicitly associated to a product). This is one of the most delicate steps, as more often than not, this is so implicit that we can easily fail to recognize such factors. A good approach consists in considering current products and listing all their attributes, for instance through ’brown paper’ brainstorming. An attribute that is consistently offered by all the players (regardless of their strategic group) is possibly a factor that is taken for granted.\n  Discovering which are the relevant factors is one of the main (if not the main) difficulties. Focussing on the right number of factors is also crucial : too few factors and the value curve is biased, too many and it becomes unusable.\nThe value curve A value curve  is a graphic depiction of a company’s relative performance across the factors of competition in its industry. It captures the current state of play in the known market space (i.e. the factors the industry is currently competing and investing) along the full customer experience (sales, product, service).\n The level of performance is more qualitative than quantitative. Sketching the value curves of the various strategic groups is what matters. Even in an industry that encompasses many players, there is usually a lot of convergence in the various value curves from the buyer’s perspective. A typical canvas will shows the classical differentiation and low cost strategies.\n  Premium products are priced high and present a high level of offering across all the key competing factors. From the buyers’ standpoint products are all different in the same way. By contrast, budget products are priced low and are also low across all the key competing factors.\nDivergence from existing value curve Once the various existing reference value propositions are depicted, one can seek to build a new value proposition by offering a very distinct mix of attributes.\n  Very often the budget and premium value curves share a similar basic shape but at different altitude. A diverging value proposition is therefore usually very distinctive.\n  The Four Action Framework To fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry, the focus must be changed from competitors to alternatives and from customers to non-yet-customers.\nFour actions can be used to reconstruct buyer value elements in crafting a new value curve.\n   Eliminate - some of the factors that the industry usually offer. Often these factors are still taken for granted even though they may no longer contribute to any value. They are the factors that are been taken for granted, and whose relevance is never questioned.\n Reduce - some factors well below the industry’s standard. More often than not, products \u0026amp; services have been over-designed in the race to match \u0026amp; beat competition. Eliminating \u0026amp; reducing factors help dropping the cost structure vis-à-vis competitors.\n Raise - some factors well above the industry’s standard. Uncover \u0026amp; eliminate the compromises your industry forces customers to make.\n Create - additional factors that the industry has never offered. Discover entirely new sources of value for buyers. Raise \u0026amp; Create lift buyer value and create new demand.\n  Explore Alternative across boundaries In making purchase decision, buyers (possibly explicitly) consider various alternatives, i.e. substitutes (products that belong to the same industry) but also products that serve the same purpose, although they may have different functions and forms.\n  Exploring why and how customers trade across alternatives (what do they value, how do the chose) usually uncover additional factors. Outside-the-box thinking is crucial at that stage, not only different industry should be explored, but also different categories of ’buyers’ (the purchaser, the user, the influencer, etc) and different customer groups.\n  The objective at that stage is to discover new factors that current industry is not considering. However, it doesn’t mean that all factors should be kept for strategy elaboration. On the contrary, the effort should not be diffuse across all key factors of competitions. The value curve should clearly show the few factors where the emphasis is put.\nExample: Southwest\u0026rsquo;s value curve Southwest (one of the first low cost airline and certainly the most profitable airline for the last forty years) built its value curve by considering the other established airlines but also transport alternatives such as the car.\n  Southwest’s value curve was made divergent by :\n Reducing Prices, Eliminating Meals, Lounges, Seating Choice (no-frills airline) Increasing Friendly service and fun, speed Creating Frequent departure (point to point, high frequency)  For further Study The Blue Ocean Strategy  web site offers valuable training materials.\nValue Innovation in Fragmented Industries A fragmented industry is composed of a large number of rather small firms. It may be the sign that the industry is nascent (still in development) and will soon consolidate.\nIt may as well correspond to an industry that is structurally prone to fragmentation, for instance due to : a lack of economies of scale (no cost advantage to large scale), high levels of customization (doesn’t fit standardized, mass production), brand loyalty playing in favor of local players (intuitu personae relationship). In addition, entry barriers are likely to be low, which means a flow of new entrants may keep the industry fragmented.\nStructurally fragmented industries are good candidates for value innovation and Blue Ocean Strategies. It takes new players to figure out how to offer more value to (some) customers while creating meaningful economies of scale and brand reputation.\nValue innovators usually seek to limit their upfront investment and therefore, chaining and franchising are their two preferred entry modes.\n Chaining consists in obtaining a cost advantage by establishing a network of additional locations – that the company owned – that is operated as a whole (e.g. through the deployment of advanced information systems). For instance, Starbuck is known for pursuing a chaining strategy : opening new stores (more than 20 000 in 63 countries) where it offers the very same value proposition.\n Franchising is similar in many respects, except than rather owning stores, the innovator – the franchisor – licenses the right to open and operate a new location to a third party – the franchise – who must stick to stick to strict operating rules (including image \u0026amp; communication).\n  Merger and acquisition is also one of the possible avenue to consolidate a fragmented industry. However it remains a very risky road and success is far from being guaranteed.\n"

	"content": " Business strategy is concerned with how much a specific business can create value. In corporate strategy the central question is ”How can you tell if your company is really more than the sum of its parts?”. i.e. Are the benefits of corporate membership greater than its costs ?\n  Corporate strategy should be guided by the vision of how a firm, as a whole, creates value. In any multi-business company, an efficient corporate strategy can contribute to value creation. Conversely a less efficient corporate strategy can destroy value.\nThis section borrows from (\u0026nbsp; [Collis98] \u0026nbsp;) Corporate Advantage According to Collis and Montgomery, creating viable corporate strategies requires combining three major ingredients: resource, business and organization.\nIn other words, it requires working on core competence, restructuring the corporate portfolios and building organizations. Besides, turning those elements into an integrated whole is the true essence of any corporate advantage.\nA successful corporate strategy must therefore be a constructed system of three interdependent parts. When a company owns the resources that are critical to the success of its businesses, it possesses a competitive advantage. When the organization is configured to leverage those resources into the businesses, synergy can be captured and coordination achieved. Finally, a good fit between a company’s measurement \u0026amp; reward systems and its business logics allows strategic control.\n  Resource Continuum The firm’s resources define the businesses that make sense for it to own and those that don’t. The resources that provide the basis for corporate advantage range along a continuum, from the highly specialized (e.g. technology specific) to the very general (e.g. management skills, corporate governance).\nFirms with specialized resources will usually compete in a narrower range of businesses (where the resources are relevant and can deliver a competitive ad- vantage) whereas firms relying upon more general resources can own a large variety of businesses\nThe type of resources also defines the most appropriate mode of coordination, from sharing (e.g. common sale force) to transferring (which preserves the autonomy and accountability of the business units).\n Relatedness trap Managers often fail to recognize that it is about resources and not about product. In their article, Collins \u0026amp; Montgomery give the example of industrial thermostats that require re- sources such as strong R\u0026amp;D capabilities, expertise in strict tolerance, made-to-order production capabilities, a technically sophisticated sale force. By contrast, in household thermostats the resource expected to be competitive are : product design \u0026amp; appearance, packaging, mass production, distribution through mass marketers \u0026amp; retailers. As a consequence, a firm that is successful in industrial thermostats is unlikely to also succeed o household thermostats. Indeed, although it could leverage some of its knowhow and competences, it would not use many of the factors from industrial thermostats and would lake most of the factors to compete in household thermostats.\n Coordination mechanism Corporate strategy seeks to deploy the resources that are key to each individual business. Resources can be either shared among several businesses or transferred across businesses with a minimum of coordination (at arm’s length).\n Public Goods (e.g. brand name, best practice) are easy to transfer, as they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous (the use by one business doesn’t reduce the availability for the others). Each business will seek to develop \u0026amp; capitalize on these valuable resources. However it may be necessary to ensure that the com- pany continue to invest in these resources and also to prevent from the re- source to loose value and/or get spoiled by one business.\n Private goods by contrast, correspond to resources that are used by several business units (e.g. sale force, MIS, join procurement, factory). A private good can be transferred to a specific business or kept at corporate level and shared across several businesses. It usually requires a lot of coordination to reach consensus on the specifications of a shared resource and to reach a compromise agreement.\n  Control system The corporate centre highly relies on its control system to steer the divisions toward the chosen strategic direction and influence performance in the individual businesses. Choices about what to measure and what to reward are therefore absolutely key.\nBy and large control systems are of two types: operating or financial. Financial control holds managers accountable for a limited number of objectives that are measurable (sale growth, return on assets). By contrast operating control aims at appraising managers’ decisions and actions (including when facing unexpected events).\nWhile most companies tend to use a mix of the two, successful corporate strategies emphasize one or the other, subject to the nature of the business in the portfolio and the relative expertise of corporate executives. Financial control is more appropriate in mature and stable industries while in fast moving industries with high levels of uncertainty, operating control is more appropriate.\nParenting Advantage According to Alexander, Campbell and Goold (\u0026nbsp; [Campbell95] \u0026nbsp;) the core question in corporate strategy is whether or not the corporate brings value to the businesses it owns.\nA parent company (corporate) sits between the shareholders and the various businesses it owns. As such, it reduces the leeway of both the shareholders and the businesses and induces additional costs. A multi business parent creates value (for the shareholders) if the various businesses perform better in aggregate than they would as a series of individual stand-alone entities. In addition, parents should strive to create more value out of their portfolio than could be achieved by any rival (other parent company, investment fund, shareholders).\nCorporate strategy triggers two major decisions:\n Parent’s characteristics how the parent should influence its business ? ”what organizational structure, management processes, and philosophy will foster superior performance from its businesses ?” Successful parents focus on a small and internally consistent set of insights that enable them to become the specialists : they are clear about their own roles.\n Portfolio What businesses should this company, rather than rival companies, own and why ? What should be added, split off or sold ? To optimize value, the parent must select the businesses so that there is a fit between the parent’s characteristics and the most significant business improvement opportunities.\n  Alexander, Campbell and Goold have coined parenting advantage the ability of a parent to create value. They consider that two conditions are necessary for a parent to provide value to its businesses: i) the corporate executives must deeply understand and feel the business of their businesses and ii) the parent must have some competences or resources that is specially helpful to its business (there must be room for improvement and the parent must be helpful). Moreover they stressed that \u0026ldquo;the fit between parent and businesses is a two-edged sword: a good fit can create additional value; a bad one can destroy value\u0026rdquo;.\n  According to them, there are several sources of value destruction:\n Standalone influence parents are involved in \u0026ldquo;agreeing and monitoring performance targets in approving major capital expenditures and in selecting the business unit managing directors\u0026rdquo;. However, parents often also interfere more deeply in product policy, marketing or human resources matters. The authors illustrate the bad influence of parents with the example of oil companies that all sought to diversify into minerals arguing that they mastered the skills and competences in natural resource exploration and extraction. There are however, many subtle differences between the oil business and the minerals and despite similarities, the two businesses relies on very different critical success factors. Corporate executives - all oil business veterans - pushed their mineral units to make poor (or sometimes bad) decisions. \u0026ldquo;The corporate executives couldn’t really get to grips with the mineral business, they couldn’t feel it\u0026rdquo;. After ten years of unsuccessful experience, oil companies have divested their minerals businesses. Usually the executive running the business are better informed / knowledgeable about their business than the parent executives.\n Linkage influence a corporate parent may seek to foster synergies across its various business. More often than not, the costs of establishing common systems and services out weight the benefit of sharing. Global processes (e.g. cross selling) require additional layers of coordinations and the overhead costs are not always compensated by additional sales.\n Central Function \u0026amp; Services establishing central services (common to several or all the units and managed centrally by the head quarter) usually implies increasing overhead costs, increasing response time and the deterioration of the quality of service as the function gets more remote from the business.\n Corporate development Research indicates that the majority of Corporately sponsored acquisitions, alliances, new ventures and business redefinitions fail to create value.\n  Assessing the parenting first Assessing the fit between a parent company and its businesses is a critical but tough question. Alexander, Campell and Goold suggest that it should encompass the following steps:\n Understanding the critical success factors for each and every business owned by the parent: what does it take to be successful ? Each industry relies on a few activities or issues that are critical to performance. Furthermore a specific business may derive a competitive advantage (firm specific advantage) from a few characteristics. A parent can create value to a set of apparently non-related business, provided that the critical success factors are not too dissimilar.\n Identify potential upsides the parent can only create value in businesses where there is room for improvement. It is therefore crucial to identify areas of improvement (potential parenting opportunities). Several sources of parenting opportunities are underlines in [Campbell et al., 1995b] : killing bureaucracy, providing financial resources, attracting and retaining top managers, improving marketing, streamlining production, economies of scale, shared and scarce expertise, lobbying and external relationships, etc. Most business could improve their performance if they had the parent with the adequate skills and abilities.\n Delineate the characteristics of the parent in this step, the focus is on the capacities of the parent. What expertise, specific capabilities, differentiating skills can the parent bring to its businesses. According to [Campbell et al., 1995b] several characteristics must be taken into account. The parent’s mental maps encompass to the (often implicit) value of the parent, its biases, simplification principles and rules of thumb. The capability of a parent to truly understand and feel a specific business, often derives from its mental maps. The parenting structures, systems and processes correspond to the mechanisms the parent usually deploy to create value. It includes the management structure and layers, the appointment principles, budgeting planning and investment approval system, governance and decision-making structures, etc. The corporate structure (specific staffs, departments at the headquarter, central functions and expertise) is also a key ingredient of parenting value creation. Last but not least the centralization / decentralization balance between the parent and its business defines the nature and perimeter of the influence the parent needs to have on its businesses.\n Fit between the parent characteristics and the potential upsides once both the potential upsides and the characteristics of the parent have been revealed, it gets easier to appraise how much the parent can bring or conversely how penalizing its influence can be. The parent that owns the proper characteristics (resources, skills, knowhow, behavior) can exploit the upside potential of the businesses. By contrast, if the parent characteristics don’t fit with the business critical success factor, there is downside in the relationship with the business.\n  The parenting Matrix The parenting matrix is built along two axes: i) how well the parent fits the business upside opportunities and ii) how well the parent characteristics fits critical success factors of the business. In other words, how much the parent can help the business and how much it understands and feels the business.\n Heartland businesses correspond to businesses where the parent both can improve the performance and deeply understand the critical success factors. Ideally, all the businesses in a group should be \u0026ldquo;heartland\u0026rdquo; businesses.\n Edge of Heartland some parenting characteristics fit but not all. Value creation is partly offset by elements that fit less and can destroy value (at least lack value creation potential). The net contribution to value is not clear-cut.\n Ballast businesses the parent understands the business extremely well and is very comfortable with the business. The parent doesn’t have howe- ver the right characteristics to help the business improve its performance. A more adequate parent would create more value. In addition, there is a danger that a change in the business environment can move a ballast business into an alien-territory business.\n Alien-Territory businesses correspond to businesses for which the pa- rent can’t help improve performance and in addition, the parent characteristics don’t fit with the critical success factors. This is the typical area where the parent destroy value.\n Value Trap businesses this is the areas where parent executives have the worst influence and make the biggest mistakes. They are business with a fit in parenting opportunity and a misfit in critical success factors. Businesses in this area can receive positive support from their parent company. However the parent executive fail to truly understand the business environment and priority. \u0026ldquo;The potential for upside gains blinds managers to downside risks\u0026rdquo;.\n  Parenting Value Adding \u0026amp; Destroying Typical value adding capabilities that can be brought by a parent company include:\n Envisioning clear overall vision and strategic intend for its business units\n Coaching assist BU managers in developing strategic capabilities, facilitate sharing among units. Corporate-wide training is usually one of the effective means to foster cooperation among BUs.\n Providing Central Service - either centralize capital investment and/or provide shared services such as HR, Legal, Communication, Information Services.\n Intervening closely monitor performance of the BUs and assist or re- place weak managers when performance doesn’t meet the targets.\n  There are also circumstances where a parent destroys value:\n Adding overhead Costs staff\u0026amp; facilities of the corporate centre(i.e.HQ) can be expensive while not producing any revenues.\n Adding bureaucratic complexity reporting, additional management layers Averaging effect - when monitoring isn’t robust enough or transparent, weak under-performing businesses can survive longer.\n  Types of Corporate Parenting roles There are three main archetypes of parenting role.\nThe portfolio manager is acting as an “agent” on behalf of the financial mar- kets. Such a parent company doesn’t get closely involved in the routine management of the various businesses, except over short period of time to improve performance. The parent company concentrate on providing (respectively withdrawing) capital investments. The CEOs of the BUs enjoy a high degree of autonomy but are given clear performance targets (with high reward in case targets are met and the risk to loose their position otherwise). The parent company periodically make evaluation about the well-being and future prospect of the businesses and review its investing/divesting schemes accordingly.\nThe synergy manager is a parent company seeking to generate value by in- creasing synergies among its BUs. It heavily relies on envisioning to create a common purpose. It also facilitate and foster cooperation among BUs. More often than not the parent company will seek to provide shared services to in- crease as much as feasible synergies. There is the risk of illusory synergies (i.e. synergies that are claimed but never materialize).\nThe parental developer is a parent company that seeks to leverage its own central capabilities to add value to its businesses. It typically focuses on resources it owns as a parent and on how to transfer downward to BUs (rather than on how to foster synergies across BUs).\n"

	"content": " Several tools and technics can be leveraged and this section is not a comprehensive list.\nStakeholder Management Stakeholder Map Stakeholders  are individuals or groups of individuals who depend on an organization to fulfill their own goals and whom, in turn, the organization depends upon.\n Although various versions of stakeholder maps exist, they are all constructed on similar principles. The objective is to plot a scatter graph and to map the power and expectation of the main stakeholders.\nStakeholder maps are usually initiated at a very early stage and maintained for the duration of the project. Maps are dynamic by essence as the behavior / beliefs of the various stakeholders can evolve.\n Interest must be understood in its broader sense. A stakeholder who is deeply resisting (for instance because his or her ’comfort zone’ would be threaten) is also considered to have a strong ’interest’. A stakeholder has interest for a project if he/she forms expectations about it, be it for or against the project.\n Power doesn’t necessarily correspond to formal authority. Trade unionists, experts, opinion makers can have a lot of power. He who can either facilitate or slow down the implementation of a project, has power. A stakeholder that has power can be in a position to impose his/her expectations or the project. Having power however doesn’t necessarily imply that power must be exercised.\n  Power  represent the ability of individuals or groups of individuals to persuade, induce or coerce others into following certain course of action [Jonhson11].\n   People in the four quadrants of the matrix must be managed adequately:\n Low interest / Low Power - corresponds to people who have little interest in the project and cannot either help or harm. They must be monitored (including in case they would ’move’ to another quadrant) but shouldn’t be bothered with excessive communication or solicitations.\n High interest / Low Power - corresponds to people who have interest in the project (either positive or negative) but will be of little help / harm. They must be kept well informed and should be involved at some point (e.g. workshops, interviews) - including when they are not supporting the project. People with a high level of antagonism can be helpful with identifying the risks and drawbacks of the project.\n Low interest / High Power - corresponds to people who have little interest in the project (either positive or negative) but have power and there- fore could decide to act for or against the project. They must be kept satisfied, kept informed but not get bored with messages. For those of them who are crucial to the decision-making and/or the strategy implementation, their level of interest (synergy) must be increased and therefore it is key to understand why their current level of interest remains low.\n High interest / High Power - corresponds to people who have a lot of interest in the project (either positive or negative) and have power to act for or against the project. They must be fully engaged and satisfied. Among these population it is important to further analyze the level of interest into its two components: synergy \u0026amp; antagonism.\n  Responsibility Charting Responsibility charting is a technique for identifying key activities \u0026amp; decision points and to clarify the responsibility that each contributor plays in relation to those activities and decisions. Contributors are allocated to activities with a specific role: Accountable, Responsible, Consulted or Informed.\n   Accountable - the person in charge and ultimately responsible for the activity, task or decision, he or she who puts his / her head on the block. This includes yes/no authority and veto power. One and only one ’A’ should be assigned to an activity. A person who is ’A’ for one activity can have other roles for other activities.\n Responsible - the doers, the persons who complete the task. Responsibility can be shared and several ’R’ can be allocated to one activity. However the number of ’R’ on one activity should remain limited. Otherwise it can be the sign that the activity should be split in several sub-activities or that some ’R’ should be ’C’ or ’I’ instead.\n Consulted - the persons who must be consulted prior to the action or decision. Consultation can take several forms such as interviews, work- shops, etc. ’C’ people (they can be experts, decision-makers or anybody with a high interest/high power) will provide inputs, guidelines and/or constraints to ’R’ people.\n Informed - the persons who must be kept informed after a decision is made or an action is completed. When the opinion of somebody must be taken into account then he/she cannot be only ’I’ (must be at least ’C’). ’C’ + ’I’ is a very common combination: the persons must be consulted prior to the action and then will be informed once the action has taken place.\n  Responsibility charting (or RACI chart) clarifies individual roles \u0026amp; responsibilities, identifies accountabilities, reduce misunderstandings, eliminate duplication of efforts and encourage teamwork. It is a table that lists the activity items and their contributors. The activities must produce an output and their names should begin with an action verb (e.g. validate, estimate, check, find, etc).\n  A usual pitfall however can be to multiply the contributors and to introduce ’checkers checking checkers’.\nIn strategy, Responsibility charting is not limited to project establishment. A ’RACI’ can be used for a wide variety of situations, such as establishing governance rules either within a firm (organization, responsibility charts between departments and units) or between a firm and its environment (supply chain, strategic alliance, etc).\nFacilitation Brown Paper Developing a strategy requires to brainstorm and challenge many ideas. Although many techniques can be mobilized to facilitate exchanges, the use of sticky notes is the most versatile and commonly used tool.\nWorking sessions can be used to delineate a market or activity domain, to brainstorm ideas \u0026amp; innovations, to appraise candidate proposals, to assess feasibility, etc. Sticky notes can also be used to draft findings (e.g. build matrices) in team. Indeed on the one hand, it is very easy to correct and adjust: a note can be moved from one cell to the next or removed, or added. On the other, it simplifies communication, whereas using a computer (even connected to a video projector) tends to create a ’communication wall’ between the facilitator and the rest of the group.\n  There are too fundamental modes for a brainstorming session.\n Guide Session - attendees generate ideas whereas the facilitator listens to them and captures all the ideas. The facilitator writes ideas on sticky notes (he/she decides what to write) and organizes the brown paper. The facilitator can stimulate the discussion and ideas production by asking questions to the group.\n Unguided Session - attendees directly produce and stick the post-it notes. This requires clear objectives and ’ground rules’ to ensure that all the attendees can get sufficient autonomy (e.g. two notes each, no more than three words per notes, active verbs, etc).\n  In practice, it is very common to combine the two modes. A warm-up exercise (the first of a session) will usually be guided to ’set the tone’ for the session. Then it is usually a good idea to alternate guided and unguided exercises to ensure that all the attendees can contribute.\n  Some people are eager to stand up, walk and stick the notes themselves. Others are more reluctant. In that case, the facilitator can gather the notes and stick them himself (herself). It can also be the best choice in large groups with many attendees.\nSessions must always be prepared. The facilitator must know what the objectives are and must guide the group while not constraining creativity and openness. Pre-print background templates (e.g. tables) can help focussing the course of a session, while plain backgrounds (’brown paper’ type) are more adapted to releasing creativity.\nPostcard from the future A Postcard form the future is a short and inspiring description of the expected future state.\nIt can be co-designed (co-written) with participants to foster their ability to think outside-the-box. The primary interest of the method is that it focusses on the What (how the future state can be reached is not addressed at first) and describes the future from the perspective of the persons who will benefit from it (e.g. customers).\nIt can also be used as an alignment tool to unsure that the persons who are in charge of making it happen do understand the objective and can visualize the destination of the journey.\n"

	"content": " The Ansoff\u0026rsquo;s Matrix The famous Ansoff’s matrix was first published in 1957 in the Harvard Business Review. It portrays the four alternative growth strategies, by considering existing products vs. new products, and existing markets vs. new markets.\n  Market penetration consists in increasing the business through offering the same product/service to the same market. Market development and Product development are sometimes called related diversification (or adjacent diversification). The idea here is to either offer new products to existing customers or to propose existing products to new markets. Product development is the most challenging option.\nMarket Penetration With Market Penetration, the firm seeks to achieve growth with existing products / services in their current market segments, aiming to increase its market share. It is the least risky strategy since it leverages many of the firm’s existing resources and it requires no change in strategic capabilities\nIn a growing market, simply maintaining market share will result in growth, and there may exist opportunities to increase market share if competitors reach capacity limits. Usually more business volume translates into some cost efficiency. However, market penetration has limits, and once the market approaches saturation another strategy must be pursued if the firm is to continue to grow.\nThere are two major downsides to Market Penetration:\n Retaliation from competitors rivalry among competitors is likely to get exacerbated, especially in mature markets. Market penetration in low- growth markets often triggers horizontal integration and consolidation (one of the player seeks to acquire its competitors).\n Legal constraints Anti trust regulations aims at limiting market power. Therefore authorities are likely to prevent consolidation beyond a certain limit.\n  Note: Retrenchment (a firm deciding to withdraw from a less attractive market) is the opposite to market penetration.\nProduct Development With Product Development the firm develops new products and/or services – i.e. with different technologies – targeted to its existing market segments.\nA product development strategy may be appropriate if the firm’s strengths are related to its specific customers rather than to the specific product itself (i.e. customer bonding, customer relationship, available customer data, \u0026hellip;). In this situation, the company can leverage its strengths by developing a new product /service targeted to its existing customers.\nDepending on the degree of relatedness, Product Development may imply acquiring/developing new strategic capabilities (e.g. new processes, new technologies, new know how, etc). Therefore it usually carries more risk (e.g. delays, cost overruns, failure) than simply attempting to increase market share.\nMarket development With Market Development the firm seeks growth by targeting its existing products to new market segments.\nMarket development options include the pursuit of additional market segments (e.g. addressing additional user needs) or geographical regions (including internationalization).\nThe development of new markets for the product may be a good strategy if the firm’s core competencies are related more to the specific product than to its experience with a specific market segment. Because the firm is expanding into a new market, a market development strategy typically has more risk than a market penetration strategy.\nDiversification With Diversification the firm grows by diversifying into new businesses by developing new products for new markets.\nDiversification is the most risky of the four growth strategies since it requires both product and market development and may be outside the core competencies of the firm. However, diversification may be a reasonable choice if the high risk is compensated by the chance of a high rate of return.\nOther advantages of diversification include the potential to gain a foothold in an attractive industry and the reduction of overall business portfolio risk.\nDiversification can occur at business level (expanding to new segments of the industry) or at corporate level (entering new businesses out of the scope of current activities). Differentiating diversification from market development or product development can be however rather subjective, as it depends on the way “new product” and “new market” are interpreted.\nIt is usually considered that there is diversification when and if a firms tries to develop a new strategic segment, which usually requires new capabilities. Although diversification can be accessible through pure organic growth (developing existing resources \u0026amp; competence), it is often associated with external growth and, in that case usually requires Mergers \u0026amp; Acquisitions and/or Alliances.\n"

Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables. Firms acquire the inputs from their suppliers in upstream markets and deliver their products or services to their direct customers in downstream markets.\nCapital Equipment: the transformation process may also require items (e.g. machinery, intellectual property) that are not transformed in the process and can be used repeatedly.\nFor B2C (Business to Consumers), customers are the final consumers of the products, whereas B2B (Business to Business firms deliver their products to other firms.\nWe start with an over-simplified case where there is a single supplier providing the goods, a single firm and a single customer acquiring the product.

However two pivotal concepts, the willingess to pay and the willingness to sell.\nfig\nHow to measure Value for the firm ? Value creation corresponds to the total perceived value net from the total expenses (including direct \u0026amp; indirect costs, Depreciation \u0026amp; Amortization) incurred to design, produce and deliver the product or service.\n  Some of this value is transferred to customers (Customer’s surplus) and some (the difference between the transaction price and the total cost of the good) is kept by the firm. Any firm must ensure that it both creates value at least for some customer groups and claims value so that it can generates some profit.\nThe total created value  is (not necessarily equitably) shared between the delivered value transferred to customers as surplus and the captured value  kept by the firm.\n Most of the time a company has suppliers (i.e. it participates to a value system). Each of the players in a value system does not receive a remuneration only in proportion to the value it creates, but as well in proportion to its market power and the exercise of that power) in the sector.\nA Firm transforms inputs into outputs Any firm, whether it produces products or services, transforms some inputs into outputs. Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables. Firms acquire the inputs from their suppliers in upstream markets and deliver their products or services to their direct customers in downstream markets.\nCapital Equipment: the transformation process may also require items (e.g. machinery, intellectual property) that are not transformed in the process and can be used repeatedly.\nFor B2C (Business to Consumers), customers are the final consumers of the products, whereas B2B (Business to Business firms deliver their products to other firms.\nWe start with an over-simplified case where there is a single supplier providing the goods, a single firm and a single customer acquiring the product. The actual price at which the product is sold and the actual price received by the supplier for the goods result from the bargaining between the customer and the firm on the one hand and between the firm and the supplier on the other. However two pivotal concepts, the willingess to pay and the willingness to sell.\nfig\nNote:In the remaining of the text, the word product will be used for any firm\u0026rsquo;s output (i.e. for both products and services.)\nWillingness to Pay The Willingness-to-Pay is the maximum price a customer is ready to pay to acquire a given good. It corresponds to what economists name usefulness, economic satisfaction or utility. This is the amount for which the customer is (theoretically) indifferent between keeping her/his money or obtaining the good. At a higher price, the customer would rather keep the money (which is worth more than the good’s utility for that customer). If offered at a price which s strictly inferior to the willingness to pay, then the customer can consider a commercial transaction. The difference between the transaction price and the perceived value is named customer’s surplus. If customers are rational, the surplus must always be positive.\n In economy, utility doesn’t convey any ethical, moral, religious or political connotation but only reflects preferences from economic agents. V. Pareto proposed to use the word ophelimity instead of utility. Likewise Irving Fisher suggested wantability, however utility was already too well established in economics literature.\n fig\nUsually Willingness to Pay cannot be easily measured. Brandburger \u0026amp; Harborne (\u0026nbsp; [Brandbuger96b] \u0026nbsp;) suggest the following thought experience to better capture the concept:\n if a rational customer is offered a product for free, he should be better off with that product than without it (economists call that the non-satiation axiom).\n from that situation, start to take money away from the customer (i.e. ask him to pay). When the amount of monety taken away is small, the customer should still prefer the situation with the product compared to the situation without the product.\n however as more money is taken away, there should be a moment when the customer prefers to keep his money and give the product back.\n the willingness to pay corresponds to the amount where the customer gauges that the situation with the product (less money) and without the product (with money) are equivalent.\n  Opportunity Cost The situation from the supplier\u0026rsquo;s perspective is symmetrical: the Willingness-to-sell (aka willingness-to-accept, reservation price) is the amount for which the supplier is indifferent between selling or not selling. A supplier would accept any price higher than the willingness to sell, but would reject any lower offer.\nfig\nThe willingness-to-pay is also known as the opportunity cost of selling, that is the value which is given up when the good is sold. The opportunity cost is the cost (loss of potential gain)incurred by not enjoying the value (utility) associated with the best alternative to selling the good.\n The employment of resource services in any manner involves a cost to the resource owners. This cost consists in their own evaluation of forgone alternatives, an evaluation made at the moment of commitment. J. Buchanan.\n Ross Gittins (\u0026nbsp; [Gittins] \u0026nbsp;) the Economics Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, stresses that the concept of Opportunity Cost while foundational to microeconomics can be misleading and even economists can get it wrong.\n The opportunity cost of a decision is the value (utility) of the next-best alternative. Imagine you win a free ticket (that cannot be resold) to see an Eric Clapton. On that same day, there is a Bod Dylan concert priced $40, knowing that you would usually be ready to pay $50 to see Dylan in concert. Going to Dylan\u0026rsquo;s concert is your best alternative to Clapton\u0026rsquo;s concert. What is the opportunity cost of going to Clapton\u0026rsquo;s concert ? $10 as you are forgoing $50 utility net from $40 costs.\n NoteAs stressed by Brandburger \u0026amp; Harborne, there must be well defined prices elsewhere in the economy (i.e. outside the modeled vertical chain) to allow the assessment of the willingness to pay and willingness to sell.\nValue Creation and Appropriation The value created by the vertical chain is the difference between customer\u0026rsquo;s willingness to pay and supplier\u0026rsquo;s opportunity cost.\nfig.\nBargaining between the players determine the how much vaue each player can capture and appropriate.\nPrice, consumer surplus, supplier surplus\nNotion of Value Network The classical view is that firms should operate in a clearly defined segment. Firms that belong to the same segment are competitors and they interact with suppliers \u0026amp; customers.\nBrandenburger and Nalebuff (\u0026nbsp; [Brandenburger96] \u0026nbsp;) two game theorists, offer a different perspective. Their central idea is that „You don’t have to blow the other fellow’s light to let your own shine” (B. Baruch). Most busi- nesses do benefit from the success of other players and Mutual success often exceeds Rivalry.\n  With the Value Net approach, companies can cooperate to grow the pie before they compete to share it. You can often be better off by collaborating with others to make the pie bigger (even if your share remain stable in percentage) rather than claiming a bigger part of a fixed pie (i.e. stealing from somebody else).\n„A player is a complementor if its value proposition increases the perceived value of your product / service” [Brandburger96]\n Intel and Microsoft are complementors for the PC market. More performant microprocessors as well as more powerful operating systems increase the value of PC. Likewise, content providers (e.g. music producers) are complementors to i-Tunes: the more artists available for download, the more value for end-users.\n„Economists call this a network effect (positive externality) or a demand-side economies if scale. When the network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the total number of customers using it\u0026rdquo;.\n Products or services that highly depend on network effect (i.e. multi-sided models) are very sensitive to quickly achieving the critical mass of users and enjoying positive feedback. Successful Value Propositions can benefit from a bandwagon effect where the rate of adoption becomes proportional to the number of people who are already using the system.\n„The opposite effect (i.e. the value of a product decrease with the number of users) is called negative network effect or congestion.\u0026rdquo;\n Sometimes, the same company can launch products that are complementors to their main business. Michelin – the tyre manufacturer – produced maps and touristic guides to encourage car trips and increase wear and tear of tyre.\n  Companies may fail to enter a market for lake of complementors. Brandenburger and Nalebuff mention the examples of Alfa Romeo and Fiat – two Italian car makers – who sought to enter the American market but had to throw the towel because no distribution / repair network was available (and establishing one was far too expensive).\nCompetition must be understood in its broad sense, that is including incumbent players but also new potential players and substitutes. As already discussed in the chapter about Value Proposition, the key question should be: what else my customers could buy to serve the same need.\nExample: The Value Network of TSM Considering the case of an University (e.g. Toulouse Graduate School of Management in the role of the Company), yield to the following roles:\n Customers Students are obvious customers (both current and prospective students). In addition the Families of the students (mainly their parents) would also be considered as customers. Likewise potential Employers should be contemplated as customers (with a different value proposition).\n Competitors other Education Institutions (Universities, Schools, etc) are obvious competitors. Other Faculties from the same University would also to some extend be competitors. MOOC (Massive On-Line Open Course) and more generally distance learning should be looked at as competitors.\n Complementors Some competitors could as well be complementors through a better alignment of offerings: MOOC, Universities. The availability of Housing, Entertainment, Cultural offers and an efficient Transportation System typically increase the Value Proposition of a University. Likewise the availability of part-time jobs for students or student loans could as well increase the University’s Value Proposition.\n Suppliers The Faculty and teachers are obvious suppliers to the University. Book publishers and training material producers would as well be suppliers. In addition, Sponsors, Donators, the State and local administrations should as well be considered as suppliers.\n  "

	"content": " Even when it is explicitly formulated, a strategy does include detailed actions for all stakeholders. On the contrary, it should focus on top level considerations and ensure alignment, while leaving a lot of freeway to the people in charge of executing.\n  Organization alignment D. Sull \u0026amp; K.M. Eisenhardt (\u0026nbsp; [Sull15] \u0026nbsp;) have rightly pointed out that if an organization’s strategy lives on the shelf then this organization has a problem. How to bridge the gap between strategy and execution? According to them, by polishing simple statements that help making on-the-spot decisions and adapting to rapidly changing circumstances\nIndeed, they argue that while a checklist or any other process adherence technique is usually well adapted in repetitive situation (e.g. safety control) to ensure the activities alignment with corporate objectives. Agreeing on a simple ’principle’ is more adequate in more dynamic environment however, where flexibility is important. Process operators can then decide the most appropriate action to cope with the principle, subject to the actual circumstances.\nIn A.C. Hax’s words the true purpose [of the strategy statement] is to capture and clearly articulate our intent. Strategy is a fundamental vehicle to communicate our sense of direction, both inside and outside the organization. It aims to give purpose and direction to an organization and end up with the proper implementation of a well-designed strategy.\nThis simple idea of not trying to fix in advance every tiny detail was made famous by D. Eisenhower who claimed No plan survive the first contact with the enemy.\n  Chip \u0026amp; Dan Heath (\u0026nbsp; [Heath07] \u0026nbsp;) hammer on the message. The planning process forces people to think through the right issues, however even if you may start off trying to fight your plan, the enemy gets a vote.\nIn the 80’s the Army invented the concept of CI (Commander’s intend): a crisp, plain-talk statement, specifying the goal, the desired end-state. You can lose the ability to execute the original plan but you never lose the responsibility of executing the CI.\nThe commander’s intend should phrase something like if we do nothing else, we must : xxx or something like the single most important thing is: xx.\nCompelling stories \u0026amp; Catch phrases The hard part in producing such a statement is weeding out ideas that are important but not the most important. Finding the core is about discarding a lot of insights to let shine the most important insight. Consistently repeating a simple statement (or intent) is the best way to ensure that all the stakeholders in the organization receive the message and then make appropriate decisions.\nChip \u0026amp; Dan Heath quote this story from Herb Kelleher, the CEO of SouthWest : *„Tracy from marketing comes into my office and she says that surveys show that the passengers might enjoy a Cesar salad on the Houston to Las Vegas flight. What do you answer? You respond: Tracy, will adding that chicken salad make us THE low-cost airline from Houston to Vegas? Because if it doesn’t help us become the unchallenged low-cost airline, then we’re not serving any damn chicken salad.*” (Southwest’s CEO)\nNo one knows if there ever existed a Tracy in Southwest Marketing, but the story drives the point home: Southwest is THE low-cost company. Southwest has been very consistent in its intent over the years and has also been one of the only consistently profitable airline for more than 30 years.\n  Telling stories is also a way to make sure the staff can remember and feel the purpose of a strategic move. According to J. Conger (\u0026nbsp; [Conger08] \u0026nbsp;) Herb Kelleher used to tell the following story when visiting his operations across the United States: „It’s funny, I get letters all the time from shareholders and they’re often angry letters. They say : ’American West is flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for $149 one way. And you, Herb Kelleher at Southwest, are pricing $79 for that same one-way ticket. Don’t you have the decency to at least kick your price up to $129 ? Why are you leaving so much on the table ?’ Well, what I do is write and reply : Thank you so much for your letter. However you don’t understand who we are, and you really don’t understand who our competition is. It’s automobile; it’s not other airlines. And $79 is the price to drive, including maintenance, insurance and gasoline, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. That’s how we price or ticket. ” (Southwest’s CEO)\n"

	"content": " A notice disclaimer\n Strategic Thinking, a Primer The notion of strategic interaction is one of the core concepts for strategic thinking.\n  Let’s assume there is a buffet and we all rush to the refreshments. As a consequence when the last two persons arrive there is only one cup of tea left. These two persons both have two options: either take or don’t take the tea.\nThis can be represented by a table or matrix, where the rows correspond to one person’s actions and the columns to the other’s.\nIf they both take the tea it is likely to spill and will be lost for both, if neither take the cup, the tea will be left. Otherwise one person will drink the tea.\nWhat is key here is that the outcome for each person (his or her payoff) not only depends upon her/his own decision but as well on the other person’s decision.\nLikewise it is important to note that if there were many cups of teas, this would no longer be a strategic interaction because whether or not one of the person takes a cup of tea, would barely have any impact on the ability of the other person to have a tea.\nThe launch dilemma The previous example is a very toy version, but still it can apply to many real life business situations.\n  We’re in the late 90s, both Airbus and Boeing have worked on Very Large Aircraft projects, they even contributed to a joint feasibility study but it became obvious that Boeing was playing for time.\nAirbus had announced its plan to develop its own aircraft, coined A3XX. The two players have the same two options : launch or don’t launch a Large Aircraft.\nThe market is too small to sustain two products and none of the player would breakeven their investments if both would launch. If none decide to launch the VLA market remains untapped, however the situation is asymmetric as Boeing already dominate the 400+ seater market with the 747. Therefore Boeing has more interest than Airbus to maintain the status quo.\nWe know how it ended up: Airbus launched the A380 and terminated Boeing’s dominance on the upper segment. As a result Boeing is phasing out its 747.\nLearning Point We all know we should Put ourselves in everybody else’s shoes but sometimes we tend to overlook some beliefs or consider that the situation is completely symmetrical where it is not.\n  The more you are able to consider a situation from the perspective of the other stakeholders, the better you can anticipate and make an educated decision.\n ##to do\nIn 1931 Pepsi-Cola had entered bankruptcy for the second time. Soda was sold in 6-ounce bottles. To save costs, Pepsi acquired a large supply of 12-ounce beer bottles. Initially they priced the 12-ounce bottle twice as much as the 6-ounce bottle, which drove sales down. In order to recover a mimimun of cash, they decided to price 12-ounce Pepsis for the same price as 6-ounce Cokes\n"

	"content": " Ex-post narrative - the Honda Case The now famous Honda Case is a perfect illustration of the difference between deliberate and emergent strategies. It also proves that convincing ex-post stories can be built by analysts who try to report and make intelligible the successful strategic moves and/or missed opportunities of firms.\nHowever, it seems that, in that case (but in how many more ?) the ex-post explanations had totally reconstructed the initial strategic intends and/or deviate from the hard facts.\nThe Honda story: the context In the 60’s Harley Davidson was the dominant player in the US motorcycle market, followed by British firms (BSA, Triumph, Norton) and Guzzi of Italy. In 1959, the British firms represented 49% of cumulated market shares. However, by 1973 they had felt to 9%, while motorcycle registrations had more than triple over the same period. Meanwhile, Honda’s sales grew from MUS$ 0.5 in 1960 to MUS$ 77 in 1965.\n  Evolution of the motorcycle industry in the US   Several articles (\u0026nbsp; [Rumelt95] [Lecrow93] \u0026nbsp;) examines the various explanations offered by analysts about Honda’s success in the US motorcycle market, in the 60’s.\nThe BCG Report In a report ordered in 1975 by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (British secretary of state for Industry), the BCG explains the decline of the British motorcycle industry and suggests strategic alternative for the future.\nBeing produced as part of a public contract, the report was openly published by the British government. The two-volume 368-page report still provides the most complete published view of a strategy boutique at work doing industry and competitive analysis.\nAccording to the BCG, Honda’s success finds its roots in cost advantage, the successful exploitation of scale and learning which then lead to what they call the segment retreat response of British and American competitors. Anyone who received an MBA in the 80’s (especially in an Ivy league University) was almost certainly exposed to this version of history.\n «The success of the Japanese manufacturers originated with the growth of their domestic market during the 1950’s. Indeed, by 1960, the Japanese had developed huge production volumes in motorcycles in their domestic market and volume-related cost reductions had followed » – BCG report, quoted in (\u0026nbsp; [Lecrow93] \u0026nbsp;) .\n   BCG Report about the evolution of the motorcycle industry   Lecrow and Morison stress that Honda decided in 1959 to invest in a plant to manufacture 30000 units per month, well ahead of existing demand at the time. This is, according to the BCG, yet an evidence of their strategy of taking position as low cost producer.\n « The rate of technological learning tends to be related over time to accumulated production experience as the company develops and applies lower cost methods in the course of conducting its business. [\u0026hellip;] High volumes per model provide the potential for high productivity as a result of using capital intensive and highly automated techniques. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe overall result of this philosophy over time has been that the Japanese have now developed an entrenched and leading position in terms of technology and production methods »\n The British found it impossible to match low Japanese price levels on small bikes. They therefore responded to the Japanese challenge by withdrawing from the smaller bike segments.\nThe real Story as it occurred Richard T. Pascale (\u0026nbsp; [Pascale84] [Rumelt96] \u0026nbsp;) offers a revisionist account of Honda’s motorcycle success.\n  The Honda Case - Interviews of the main protagonists   According to Mr. Kawashima (\u0026nbsp; [Pascale84] \u0026nbsp;) , who became the first president of American Honda, the small Japanese team arrived in the U.S. with only weak English language skills, and a vague plan to compete with European exports in the 250cc to 300cc size range. Their first attempt was a failure.\n We dropped in on motorcycle dealers who treated us discourteously and gave the general impression of being motorcycle enthusiasts who, secondarily, were in business. There were only 3000 motorcycle dealers in the US of which only 1000 were open five days a week. Inventory was poor and manufacturers sold motor- cycles to dealers on consignment. The retailers provided consumer financing. After-sales services was poor. It was discouraging. [\u0026hellip;]\nHowever as 60000 motorcycles were imported from Europe, it didn’t seem unreasonable to shoot for 10% of the import market. In truth we had no other strategy than the idea of seeing if we could sell something in the US. [\u0026hellip;]\nWe were entirely in the dark the first year. We were not aware the motorcycle business in the US occurs during a seasonable April to August window and our timing coincided with the closing of the 1959 season. Our hard-learned experiences with distributorships in Japan convinced us to try to go to the retailers directs.\nBy spring of 1960 we had 40 retailers and some of our inventory - mostly larger bikes - in their stores. By April 1960, reports were co- ming that our motorcycles were leaking oil and encountering clutch failure. Honda’s facile reputation was being destroyed before it could be established. Our testing Lab in Japan worked twenty-four-hour a day and within a month a new design was available »\n In the early 60’s, motorcycles attracted barely anyone and had grew bad reputation – „*the stereotype of the motorcycle by then, was a leather-jacketed, teenage trouble-maker*” ([ibidem]). According to the interviews of the management team of Honda America, this is this factor that initially prevented them from offering their 50cc on the American market, although it was already acclaimed in Japan.\n We had not attempted to sell our 50cc Supercubs, despite their huge success in Japan. In the US, we thought, the market was expecting bigger and more luxurious machines. However we used the Honda 50cc ourselves to ride around Los Angeles. They attracted a lot of attention and one day we received a call from a Sears buyer. We took note of Sears’s interest but persisted in our refusal to sell through an intermediary. We still were very hesitant to push the 50cc bikes, out of fear that they might harm our image in a heavily macho market\n In the spring of 1963, an undergraduate marketing student at UCLA designed an ad campaign in fulfillment of a course assignment. Lecrow and Morison (\u0026nbsp; [Lecrow93] \u0026nbsp;) report that when Grey Advertising (who had acquired the rights from the student) tried to sell the idea, the Honda management team was split on the decision.\nHonda however adopted the campaign and launched their 50cc on the US market. The ad campaign was featuring clean-cut people with ready smiles, including fashionable women, with a very strong slogan.\nAs demand grew, the entry team reinvested profits back into the U.S. business. Honda then progressively re-invested all the market segments. In ’*Blue Ocean Strategy*’ terms, Honda extended the industry boundaries and discovered an untapped market space.\n  The Honda Case - Ex post Story   Rather than trying to outperform establish competitors to grab a greater share of existing demand, they managed to create a new demand through a new set of product attributes. Building on their solid reputation and brand notoriety, they grew to other segments and started to dominate the market.\nWhatever the degree of conviction of an explanation, always seek to objectively analyze the true situation and form a fact-based judgment.\n Strategy Goes beyond firms Strategy deals with long-term goals and value creation. Both terms must be understood in a broad sense. As a result, strategic management is not limited to firms.\nThis section draws from (\u0026nbsp; [Grant06] \u0026nbsp;) .\nMariah Carey\u0026rsquo;s strategic moves Mariah Carey, an American singer, songwriter and actress, made her debut in 1990 with the release of an eponym studio album: Mariah Carey. The album went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. She then continued with a series of hits, all produced by Columbia Records: Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993) and Merry Christmas (1994). Daydream (1995), made music history when the second single, One Sweet Day spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Bill- board Hot 100. It remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. From 1990 to 2000 she sold more than 140 million albums, hitting an all time record [source Wikipedia]. Beyond her indisputable commercial success, Mariah Carey also became a benchmark artist of R\u0026amp;B.\n  In 2001 she left Columbia Records and signed a record-breaking $100 mil- lion five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records). She moved away from R\u0026amp;B and introduced more hip-hop into her arrangements. She also started a career as actress with Glitter and also signed the sound- track of the movie. Both the public and media very poorly received her performance, judged disappointing. In 2001 she received the Golden Raspberry Award (Razzie) for Worst Actress.\nGrant reports that in 2002, Lyor Cohen (the chief executive of Island Def Jam records) spotted an opportunity: \u0026gt; „I cold called her and said, I think you are an unbelievable artist and you should hold your head up high. What’s your competitive advantage? A great voice, of course, and what else? You write all songs: you are a great writer. So why did you stray from your competitive advantage? If you have this magnificent voice and write such compelling songs, why are you dressing like that? Why are you using all these collaboration with other artists?”.\nIn 2005, she launched a new album, returning to her initial R\u0026amp;B style. It debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics. The album’s second single, We Belong Together, became a ’career re-defining’ song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over. Music critics heralded the song as the ’return of The Voice’, After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second longest running number one song in US chart history and Billboard listed it as the ’song of the decade’ and the ninth most popular song of all time. The album earned ten Grammy Award nominations: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year) and two in 2007 for the Ultra Platinum Edition. In 2006 Carey won Best Contemporary R\u0026amp;B Album for The Emancipation of Mimi as well as Best Female R\u0026amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R\u0026amp;B Song for We Belong Together [source Wikipedia]\nThere is not \u0026lsquo;One-fit-all\u0026rsquo; strategy Mariah Carey was very successful from 1990 to 2000. From 2000 to 2005 she adopted a ’new strategy’ and became far less successful. When in 2005, she returned to her ’initial strategy’, success came back immediately. One could argue that there is only ’one best way’ to achieve success and any attempt to do otherwise is doomed to failure.\n  However can you think of singers who has been quite successful by adopting the behavior that was fatal to M. Carrey?\nStrategy Making „No one has ever seen or touched a strategy ” (\u0026nbsp; [Mintzberg78] [Mintzberg00] \u0026nbsp;) . Every strategy is an invention, a creation shared by the members of an organization, through their intentions and by their actions.\nA major issue of strategy formulation becomes therefore to understand how intentions diffuse through an organization to become shared and how actions come to be exercised on a collective, yet consistent, basis.\nAs a process Strategy is not linear and not limited to its economics perspective. It also encompasses sociological aspects: the people side of managing strategy implementation.\nStrategy formation A large body of literature address the question of how organizations make their significant decisions. Henry Mintzberg distinguishes three main theoretical modes:\n Planning Mode - (by far the largest body of published materials) depicts a highly ordered process: strategies are explicitly and intentionally produced and formulated by a purposeful organization.\n Adaptative Mode - in contrast, portrays the process as one in which many decision-makers (sometimes with conflicting goals) bargain among themselves to produce a stream of incremental, disjoint decisions.\n Entrepreneurial Mode - corresponds to a situation where a powerful leader takes bold, risky decisions toward his vision of the future of the organization.\n  Strategy Lenses A more recent analysis (\u0026nbsp; [Johnson11] \u0026nbsp;) proposes four different perspectives (or lenses). Each and every approach brings its own perception bias but also specific insight.\n Strategy as Design - assumes that a comprehensive strategy blueprint can be established before any implementation starts (see planning mode above). It therefore puts a lot of emphasis on analyzing and planning. Reacting quickly to unpredictable event is nearly excluded. Strategy formulation is systematic, linear and logic driven. It underplays the political aspects of human organizations.\n Strategy as Experience - considers that the future strategy must draw on the past experience of the organization and its managers. Decisions are based on less clear-cut analyses and often result from negotiated compromise. Radical change is unlikely to occur.\n Strategy as Variety - focuses on fostering the emergence of disruptive ideas. It promotes diversity (e.g. opens the strategy debate to a vast variety of people within and without the organization) and idea generation.\n Strategy as Discourse - underpins power games among decision makers and politics.\n  Different Strategy levels Although there is no formal consensus on a definition of “strategy ” it is usually recognized that strategy can operate at three distinct levels : Corporate Strategy, Business Strategy, Functional Strategy (aka operational strategy).\n   Strategy levels    Corporate Strategy\nCorporate Strategy focuses on the various businesses owned by the organization and how value can be added to the constituent businesses of the organization as a whole. It deals with the scope and business boundaries (geographical, product portfolio span, global resource allocation).\n Business Strategy \nBusiness strategy defines how individual businesses should compete in their own market / arena (innovation, response to competitors’ move) and how to over-perform competition.\nFunction strategy\nSometimes firms stress how the various components of an organization (i.e. Functions such as Human Resources, Research \u0026amp; Technologies, Finance, Procurement, Manufacturing, etc\u0026hellip;) deliver their contribution to the strategy (e.g. resources, people, processes).\nThere is no silver bullet Each situation calls for its own interpretation and own problem-solving approach that needs to be designed purposely. Consequently strategists must remain very open and flexible: they must adapt themselves to the organization for which they work and to its constraints.\nEach strategist must discover the few frameworks or models that she/he finds the most meaningful and can use as her/his own navigation aids.\n What Strategy for your Strategy Predictability is not comparable in the oil industry and in the Internet software industry. From this obvious observation, M Reeves, C. Love and Ph Tillmans Reeves et al. (\u0026nbsp; [Reeves12] \u0026nbsp;) derive that companies in very dissimilar competitive environment should be planning and developing their strategies in different ways.\nStrategy-Making must match competitive environment nature The oil industry holds few surprises for planners: factors are well identified and outside any single company’s control, barriers to entry are very high, no one is really in a position to change the game. In game theory terms, the oil industry is a game in complete information. By contrast, the Internet software industry is characterized by new firms suddenly popping up from nowhere. The basis of competition can be fundamentally altered without much warning. In such an environment, competitive advantage comes from reading and responding to signals faster than your rivals.\nThe strategy-making process should match the nature of the competitive environment. Obviously many factors play into strategy formulation, however two characteristics are of prime importance: predictability and malleability.\n Predictability: measures how far in the future and how accurately you can confidently forecast (e.g. demand, performance, competition dynamics, etc..).\n Malleability: measures to what extend you (and your competitors) can influence the industry and market.\n    These two characteristics delineate four perspectives each corresponding to its own specific strategy-making strategy.\nFour Strategy-making strategies  Classical - little malleability, good predictability - The influencing factors of the industry you operate in are well known and identified, the competitive environment is very stable. However you barely can change the environment (e.g. due to the atomicity of each firm). The canonical strategy formulation process, as taught in business schools, assumes this very competitive environment. It is not big surprise that most strategy-making frameworks are designed for such a ’classical’ competitive environment. Within the classical perspective a company sets a goal, capitalizing from its capabilities and tries to fortify that position. Strategy aims at optimizing long-term returns and careful planning feeds multi-annual forecasts. Strategy planning hinges upon specific skills and competences – both analytic and quantitative – and usually will be carried out by a dedicated, stand-alone department.\n Adapting - little malleability, very unpredictability - A carefully crafted ’classical’ strategy can become obsolete within months or weeks. In such a volatile competitive environment flexibility and the capability to refine/revise plans and targets is what makes the difference. Strategy formulation must then become more agile and experimental. The best bet is to constantly and quickly, produce, rollout and test a variety of products. For instance, ZARA, the Spanish retailer, can design, manufacture and ship new products in less than two weeks. Zara assesses market reaction with small batches and if they prove a hit then ramp-up production. Operations (the capability to quickly react and adapt) is the key success factor when a company is confronted to such a competitive environment. Strategists can no longer work in isolation and on the contrary, must be tightly linked with (or embedded into) operations.\n Shaping - lot of malleability, very unpredictability - this typically corresponds to new, high growth industries with low barriers to entry / high rate of innovations. Demand is very hard to predict and the course of industry can shift radically. A mature but very fragmented industry can also become a shaping environment. The strategy here consists in not trying to plan or adapt (follow) but in trying to shape the unpredictable so that it benefits to the company whatever turns out: „*The best way to predict the future is to invent it*” (John Scully, Chairman, Apple Computer). A typical approach is to build a complete ecosystem of customers, suppliers, complementors; to create a platform and to set standards and practices.\n Visionary - lot of malleability, very predictability - sometimes not only can the future be predicted and forecast, but a single company have the power to shape the future. A visionary strategy considers that the environment can be modeled and distorted to its benefit. In 1994, UPS realized that the rising of e-business and online retailers would drive an unprecedented demand for delivery services. UPS had the vision, the means and the will to make the necessary investment ($1 billion a year during several years) and to become what they later called the enablers of global e-commerce. UPS integrated its core package-tracking operations with those of web providers and expanded its global delivery capacity through acquisition. By 2000 UPS had captured in excess of 60% of the e-commerce delivery market.\n  Thing[Long \u0026amp; Hard] before you choose A team of researchers (\u0026nbsp; [Lafley12] \u0026nbsp;) has been wondering why does strategic planning consume so many resources and so much time while having so little impact?.\nThis would be, according to them, mainly due to strategic planning only faking scientific approach despite apparent rigor and extensive analysis. Therefore they suggest one could escape this pitfall through a seven-step decision process that systematically scans well-articulated possibilities to ensure that different options are looked at, explored and probed, before any choice is made.\nStep1: Frame a choice\nConventional strategy planning starts from the issue to be solved (i.e. decreasing revenues) which drives a strong tendency to get very emotional and to invest in analyzing the issues rather than working out solutions. By contrast, the approach should consist in framing the problem as a ’choice’ (for instance by defining mutually exclusive options that could resolve the issue in question). This framing helps strategists conduct stronger analyses and the managers internalize what is truly at stake.\nIn 1990s, Procter \u0026amp; Gamble was eager to become a major player in the global beauty care sector (their objective), still they only controlled small, down-market brands (e.g. Oil of Olay) and only addressing an aging consumer base. Rather than dwelling too much on this weakness, Procter \u0026amp; Gamble formulated two options:\n dramatically transform ’Oil of Olay’ into something comparable to L’Oréal, Clarins, etc,\n spend billions into acquiring an existing skin care brand\n  Step2:Generate strategic possibilities\nOnce options are identified, the second step consists in constructing strategic possibilities (including genuinely new ones). A possibility is a ’story’ that describes how a firm might success [how the option can materialize]. It needs to be consistent and ’valid’, however it doesn’t need to be proved at that stage. Any possibility must explicit\n the advantage it aims to achieve or leverage,\n the scope across which the advantage applies,\n the activities throughout the value chain that would deliver the intended advantage.\n  This step should involve a team of people from different backgrounds and expertise while trying to avoid as much as possible people emotionally bond to the ’Status Quo’. Operational managers should take part to the complete exercise, as when planners are different from doers then what gets done is different from what get planned. Several techniques can be mobilized to work out possibilities:\n inside-out possibility generation – start with assets and capabilities and reason outward: what does this company do especially well that parts of the market might value and that might produce profit?\n outside-in possibility generation – what are the underserved needs? What are the needs that customers find hard to serve?\n far-outside-in possibility generation - what would it take to become the Google, the Apple or the WallMart of this market?\n  A good set of possibilities must contain at least one possibility that directly questions the status quo (while being considered as feasible and bringing some interest) and at least one possibility that is far enough from the status quo (even if it is not sure it could be doable and/or safe at all).\nStep3: Specify the conditions for success\nIn practice, this step should make explicit the conditions that need to hold true for the possibilities (identified in step 2) to be a success. This is achieved through producing declarative statements such as for possibility P to succeed, condition X must be true. Where typical conditions encompass: the industry structure, the strategic segments, consumer structure and volume, distribution channel, capabilities, costs, competitors’ likely reactions. (for instance ’Channel partners will support us’).\nWhen the list of conditions is established, it should be screened again to eliminate all the nice to have conditions while keeping the must-have.\nAt that stage one should refrain from being judgmental and/or expressing their opinions about whether a condition is true or not. The only question is whether or not one would advocate for this possibility, provided that all the conditions were true.\nStep4: Identify barriers to choice\nOnce conditions are identified, one must determine which are more likely to hold true. Typically one would ask each teammate to raise their concerns and to rank the conditions by likelihood. More often than not there will be a consensus on most conditions (either that they hold true or that they don’t).\nHowever the group may have contrasted opinions on a few conditions. Pay close attention on these conditions and also on the people who are the most skeptical: they will be the biggest barriers (potentially a valid obstacle in case of problematic possibilities).\nStep5: Design test for barrier conditions\nOnce the key barriers have been identified they must be tested to determine whether they can hold true or not. Several techniques can be mobilized: survey, data crunching and interviews.\nThe teammate who is the most skeptical about a given condition should design and lead the test for that condition, as this person will have the highest standard of proof.\nStep6: Conduct the tests\nAt that stage, all the conditions must be checked according to the test protocols defined at step 5. Probing the conditions in the reverse order of confidence (the lazy’s man approach to choice)often turns out to be the most efficient. Indeed as soon as a condition appears to be false, the associated possibility can be eliminated (and there is no need to further test the conditions that are a prerequisite to that possibility only).\nStep7: Make choice\nWith the possibilities based approach, making the final decision – that is deciding the strategy – only requires choosing the possibility that remains when all barriers have been identified and tested.\n"

	"content": " Any firm, whether it produces products or services, transforms some inputs into outputs (aka Value Propositions). Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables.\n Note: the transformation process may also require items (e.g. machinery) that can be used repeatedly. Such items are called Capital Equipment and are not transformed in the process.\n Economists call inputs factors and say that firm combine factors. They also represent the transformation as a so called production function. The function is characteristic of the technology (i.e. production processes) used. For a given production function, the output (and therefore the cost of producing the output) is a function of the various inputs.\n  A variation in outputs/inputs will translate into a variation in costs. Moreover the variation in costs in usually not linear (producing more doesn’t necessarily imply overspending in proportion).\n Value Architecture is therefore aiming at finding optima, all things being equal. Besides, Value Architecture is also concerned with looking for and introducing new production functions, that is new ways of generating similar results (aka process innovation / technology innovation).\nUsually a single firm will not transform raw materials into end products / services. By contrast, firms will specialize into some segments of the so-called Value System (the sequence of all the intermediate value chains from raw materials to final products).\n Business ecosystems are „are heterogeneous coalitions of companies from different sectors, forming strategic communities of interests or values and structured in networks around leaders that are able to impose or share their commercial visions or technological standards” (Torres-Blay).\n Vertical Boundaries of the Firm First, a firm needs to decide where it wants to operate along the Value System (or vertical chain). Any production process can be described as a sequence of stages (including inbound and outbound logistics, distribution and retailing) that flows from the raw inputs to the end customer.\n « The production of any good or service usually requires many activities. The process that begins with the acquisition of raw materials and ends with the distribution \u0026amp; sale of finished goods and service is known as the vertical chain » [Besanko]\n The vertical boundaries of a firm delineate the activities that the firm performs on its own, as opposed to purchases from the market..\n Note: Each stage can represent an industry in its own right, which is subject to specific competitive forces).\nWithin the production process, upstream activities are close to raw material and downstream activities to the end consumption.\n  A firm that participates in more than one successive stage of the process is vertically integrated. Integration can be achieved through external growth (e.g. acquisition) or organic growth (green field development).\nA backward integrated firm produces its own inputs whereas a forward integrated firm becomes its own ’customer’ (but there still should be some ’end customer’ at the end of the value chain). Integration can be hybrid in so that a firm may for instance decide to build some of its inputs while still relying on its suppliers for other inputs.\n  As an alternative to integration, a firm may decide to establish strategic alliances and/or tight contractual relationships with some upstream or downstream firms (e.g. franchise network). Such schemes are sometimes called quasi-integration.\nWhen a firm decide to outsource some activities (i.e. purchase from the market) this is called vertical disintegration.\nNotion of Value Chain The concept of Value Chain was introduced by Porter (\u0026nbsp; [Porter85] \u0026nbsp;) in its seminal book. An internal value chain is the description of all the steps taken by the company to deliver the value proposition to their customer. It identifies the firm’s activities and their interaction. The model applies to one specific business (i.e. at business strategy level and not at corporate strategy level).\n  Classically activities are broken down into primary activities (directly adding value toward the output - i.e. that vary directly with the level of production) and support activities (that contribute indirectly to the output or are non adding any value to the product/services but are mandatory, for instance accounting).\nThe actual list of activities and the relevance of the categories are highly dependent on the type of business. For a multi-product firm (where support activities are shared among various business lines) the analysis can become tedious and allocating support costs to the various products can be very subjective.\nHowever, when establishing a business case for a new product/service line, the value chain framework is a good framework to ensure that some activities are not neglected and/or some costs are not under-estimated.\n  The value chain analysis is actually two-fold: identifying the sequence of activities and, for each and every activity, characterize how inputs are transformed and which resources are used / consumed in the process (cost structure and value addition to the customer).\nMake vs Buy The decision to rely on the market (buy from suppliers) or to produce internally (make) is often called a make vs buy decision.\nA highly integrated firm performs most activities in-house. For instance, Benetton dyes fabrics, designs and assembles clothing, and operates retail stores [Besanko]. Other firms focus only on the design of their products while having already outsourced all their production.\n By and large, a firm will decide to make (i.e. to produce internally) if it has the capability, the capacity and if it can produce at a cost equal or less than what the market can offer. Otherwise the firm would decide to buy.\n It is noteworthy that Make vs Buy is not about deciding which production steps can be eliminated. Instead it is about deciding which steps should be performed in-house (or procure from suppliers) by the firm.\n  The external value chain describes how the business model of the company fits into a broader, sectoral logic. It underlines how the various players (suppliers, complementors) are contributing to value creation for customers. It may as well highlight which are the potential ways of improving the business model.\nClassically several aspects must be taken into account before deciding to outsource activities:\n Does it solve a problem? although an obvious question, companies sometimes fail to identify the problems (e.g. capacity, cost, competence) that they are seeking to solve, before looking for an external provider.\n What degree of integration? with the other activities of the firm and how much is it contributing to the competitive advantage. Is the firm outsourcing activities or its complete business (which can be extremely risky).\n Will it improve performance? i.e.reduce costs, improve quality, shorten lead-time, increase higher reactivity, etc.\n Will it transform fixed costs into variable costs? reduce financial risks \u0026amp; capital expenditure, increase flexibility\n  Choosing the market usually brings several benefits such as\n market firms can produce at a lower cost: i) as they aggregate the needs of many customers and serve a larger demand, they can achieve economies of scale (hence lower cost) that in-house production cannot, ii) being more specialized they can enjoy the experience effect earlier\n specialized market firms can be more innovative or simply control a set of skills \u0026amp; competence that are not available internally\n in a competitive market, firms seek to increase their efficiency and eliminate bureaucracy\n  However it may as well come with some drawbacks:\n Coordination costs (production flows from different sources) and risk of production flow disruption\n Transaction costs (see below)\n Leaking of private information (Intellectual property, forecast, etc\u0026hellip;)\n  Frequent Make vs Buy Fallacies Make vs Buy is not black or White and there is a continuum between on the spot market access and full integration. Furthermore a firm may decide to insource some activities. This can be achieved organically or by acquiring one of the existing suppliers (or a firm that competes with the existing suppliers).\n  Firms should make rather than buy an input if that input is a source of competitive advantage. An input that can be (easily) acquired by any player from the market cannot be a source of competitive advantage.\nFirms should make rather than buy to avoid paying a profit to a third party in other words, firm should backward integrate to capture the profit of its supplier. A Make or Buy decision must be looked at from the perspective of the firm and therefore the cost of making must be compared to the cost of purchasing (how much of that cost is captured as profit by the supplier is irrelevant).\nBureaucracy Effects Although the term bureaucracy only appeared in the middle of the 18th century, it is associated with organized administrative systems that many forms of government have developed since 3500BC.\nFor strategists (and economists) however bureaucracy relates to control activities within a firm. It is often considered waste as i) it doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly contribute to the production process and ii) it is associated with conflict of interest, agency problems and influence costs.\nWe say that Managers and/or workers are \u0026lsquo;shirking\u0026rsquo; when they are not acting in the best interest of their firm.\n Agency costs are the costs associated with i) shirking, ii) administrative audit and control and iii) deterrence measures to prevent shirking. A common way to limit shirking is to reward managers for the profit that their efforts contribute to the firm (bonus, stock options, etc\u0026hellip;). However it is not always straightforward to evaluate such profit, even less for activities that are insulated from competition because they have captive internal customers.\nInfluence costs as Paul Milgrom and John Roberts (\u0026nbsp; [Milgrom90] \u0026nbsp;) call them, are another class of costs that often arise. The various departments or teams in a firm compete for funding, indeed there are often more ideas and requests than available budget. Managers will often seek to command more of their company\u0026rsquo;s resources to advance their career (and receive more personal reward), possibly at the expense of the company profit. To do so, manager may engage in a set of influence activities, including exaggerating the merits of their projects, badmouthing proposals from others, withholding information or key personnel. As a result of this asymmetry of information, resources (people, capital) are inefficiently allocated.\nTransaction Costs A complete contract stipulates each party\u0026rsquo;s rights and duties for each and every contingency that could happen during execution. It is very challenging to specify a complete contract as all potential contingencies must be identified and the associated course of actions for the two parties precisely defined.\nIn addition the required level of performance must be defined as well as means of measuring the actual performance during execution. Last but not least, the contract must be enforceable (for instance by a tribunal).\n «Contracts list the set of tasks that each contracting party expects the other to perform and specify remedies in the event that one party doesn\u0026rsquo;t fulfill its obligations. If a firm could be certain that its partner would never shirk, there would be no reason for a contract.» [Besanko]\n   Most real-life contracts are incomplete (they don\u0026rsquo;t fully eliminate opportunities for shirking) mainly because i) it is non-realistic to identify all contingencies (even less for long-term contract), ii) it is very challenging to fully specify courses of actions and iii) very often the parties don\u0026rsquo;t have equal access to all information.\nThe concept of transactions cost was coined by Nobel prize winner R. Coase and initially disseminated by O. Williamson another Nobel Prize winner (\u0026nbsp; [Coase37] [Williamson81] \u0026nbsp;) . Coase stressed that if relying on the market was always more efficient than making within a firm, there would be no firm. He concluded that there must be some additional specific costs that are incurred when a firm buy from the market.\nWilliamson detailed what is encompassed into transaction costs: the time and expense of i) identifying suppliers, ii) seeking information, iii) negotiating, iv) writing and enforcing a contract as well as the costs incurred when suppliers exploit incomplete contracts to act opportunistically.\nIncomplete contracting always entails some transaction costs, the largest part of which being the adverse consequence of opportunistic behavior and the costs of trying to prevent them.\nA factor is said to be Relation-specific when it supports a particular contract and cannot be redeployed (or at a significant cost). For instance a manufacturing die (used to cut and shape material using a press) is both expensive and specific of the part being built. If a firm use an external design office and impose non-standard formats (e.g. software, methodology, unwritten routines) the corresponding skills and competence are relation-specific. Physical locations (e.g. factory or warehouse nearby the customer) are also relation-specific factors. Williamson stresses that once the parties have made a relation-specific investment a fundamental transformation unfolds and the relationship evolves from \u0026ldquo;many options\u0026rdquo; bargaining situation to \u0026ldquo;limited or single option\u0026rdquo;.\nThe relation-specific investment is the portion of the investment that cannot be recovered in case the contract doesn\u0026rsquo;t materialize. The quasi-rent is the extra profit derived from the materialization of the contract compared to the next-best alternative once the investment is made. When an asset is specific, the quasi-rent is strictly positive (i.e. the next-best alternative is not as good as the contract materialization). At the extreme, the investment is so specific that the quasi-rent is the full profit of the contract.\nHoldup problem if the quasi-rent is substantial (i.e. the supplier has a lot to lose), the customer may be tempted to exploit in one way or another breaches in the contract and renegotiate at a lower price once the investment is made.\n  Power plants are highly specialized assets. To avoid the hold-up problem (in developing countries), power plants are built on floating barges, thereby the geographic specificity can be partially eliminated and if a government defaults or seeks to leverage opportunistic behaviors, the power plant can be relocalized elsewhere at low cost. [Besanko]\nWhy seeking to vertically integrate ? Vertical integration can be driven by several reasons:\n Transaction Costs a firm incurs costs besides the price when trading with other (e.g. searching and assessing potential suppliers, running selections, writing and enforcing contracts). A firm that vertically integrate avoids such costs (however it incurs new management and control costs).\n Avoid opportunistic behavior it can be very difficult and costly to anticipate all potential situations in a contract. Therefore there is a risk that one of the parties may want to take advantage of the other if the circumstances permit. Usually the solution consists in signing long-term agreements, where most of the attributes of the relationship are clearly specified. However when the risk of opportunistic behavior is too high (for instance when a firm only deal with one other firm), integration is preferable to any commercial relationships.\n Asymmetry of information when one firm owns private knowledge that canât be taken into account when the contract is established, that firm is likely to seek taking advantage of the less knowledgeable firm. If the buyer anticipates the asymmetry, it will increase monitoring and will therefore incur additional costs.\n Control quality and ensure steady supply when a supplier deliver components that are crucial, are difficult to store or represent high unit price, the buyer will try to control production. Alternatively, the buyer may decide to integrate its key suppliers and take full responsibility for the supply.\n Avoiding regulation /Anti-trust firms may also vertically integrate to avoid government price controls, taxes, and regulations. A vertically integrated firm avoids price controls by selling to itself (internal transaction). Firms also integrate to lower their taxes. Tax rates vary by country, state, and type of product. A vertically integrated firm can shift profits from one of its operations to another simply by changing the transfer price at which it sells its internally produced materials from one division to another.\n Eliminating Market Power a firm that faces direct suppliers or retailers that are too strong may try to either foster competition (even sometimes create competitors) or eliminate that market power by vertically integrating.\n  Property Rights of the Firm Integration allows the firm to control resources, costs and profit when contract are incomplete and partners would disagree. When contracts are complete it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter who own the assets.\nAccording to Oliver Hart, Sanford Grossman and John Moore: \u0026laquo; Integration determines the ownership and control of assets, and it is through ownership and control that firms are able to exploit contractual incompleteness. \u0026raquo;\nIf a firm rely on a partner\u0026rsquo;s asset, it will have to persuade the partner to cooperate (or to execute the contract). By contrast, if the firm owns the asset it can decide (residual rights of control) how to use that asset as new opportunities unfold.\nHorizontal Boundaries of the Firm The Horizontal boundaries correspond to the quantity (and variety) of product sold by a single firm. The horizontal boundaries can be measured in market share. Economies of scale, scope and experience allow some firm to derive of cost advantage that can translate either in lower price or higher profit.\nHorizontal boundaries must be understood within a segment of the Value system (i.e. within one given industry). It mainly relates to the size of a company and how much market share it controls.\n  A firm can expand its horizontal boundaries through organic growth (increasing its production level / sales) or through acquisition of firms operating in the same industry. The principal benefit of engaging in horizontal integration is that i) it eliminates competition from other firms and ii) it allows to increase economies of scale (when applicable) and reduce the average unit costs.\nAs vertical and horizontal integrations can significantly modify the market power of firms, they are under the scrutiny of governments and antitrust authorities.\n Economics 101 This is only a brief introduction. The interested reader should turn to reference books such as ((\u0026nbsp; [Besanko13] [Pindyck12] [Mas-Colell95] [Varian14] \u0026nbsp;) )\nTotal costs, fixed costs, variable costs\nThe total cost \\( TC \\) of producing a quantity \\( q \\) (considered as a flow i.e. production of a certain quantity in a given period of time â usually a year or a month) is the sum of fixed costs \\( FC \\) which donât depend on \\( q \\) and variable costs \\( VC \\) which is a function of \\( q \\).\n\\[ TC(q) = FC + VC(q) \\]\nNote: \\(VC(q)\\) is the cost of producing \\(q\\) units (and not the unitary cost when the level of production is \\(q\\).\n  It is noteworthy that the notion of fixed vs variable depends on the considered time horizon. In the very short term most costs are fixed (as a firm can usually not react instantaneously to changes) and by contrast in the very long run all costs are variable (a firm may decide to sell existing fixed assets or on the contrary to acquire additional ones). Usually we consider that i) a firm commits to a production technology, tooling and facilities (fixed costs) with a maximum output level and ii) the firm can adjust its production level (variable costs) within these boundaries.\n Selecting a technology induces a total cost function. Two different technologies (i.e. two different ways to produce the same outputs) will usually have different fixed and variable costs.\n Selecting a production level determines the average cost. For a given production level, the notion of average costs helps comparing the two.\n  Average costs\nThe average cost \\( AC \\) is the total cost (at a given level of production) divided by the quantity produced.\n\\[ AC(q) = \\frac{TC(q)}{q} = \\frac{FC + VC(q)}{q} \\]\nWhy is this notion important? Because it provides a per-unit-cost. In other words, knowing that the production level is \\( Q \\), then we can consider that it costs \\( n.AC(Q) \\) to the firm to produce \\( n \\) pieces of output (don\u0026rsquo;t confuse \\(n\\) the number of costed units with \\(Q\\), the total production level ).\n\\( AC \\) is usually not constant (i.e. it depends on \\(Q\\) the total quantity produced). The average cost curve is usually U-Shaped (although it can also be L-Shaped).\n  In many industries, the average cost tend to decrease with production volume. This is for instance, the case when fix costs are high relative to variable costs (the amortization of fix costs can be spread over more units). When the production level reaches a certain threshold, the average cost remains stable over a production range and starts to increase again above a certain level.\nMarginal costs\nThe marginal cost (at a given production level) is the incremental cost of producing one additional unit.\n\\[ MC(q) = \\frac{TC(q + \\Delta q) - TC(q) }{ \\Delta(q)} = - \\frac{FC + VC(q +\\Delta q) - FC - VC(q) )}{\\Delta q} = \\frac{ VC(q +\\Delta q) - VC(q) )}{\\Delta q}\\]\nIn other words, \\( MC \\) is the derivative of \\( TC \\) as well as \\( VC \\) (\\( FC \\) being a constant, its derivative is null).\n\\[ MC(q) = \\frac{d TC(q)}{dq} = \\frac{d VC(q) }{ dq} \\]\nThe derivative of the Average cost is\n\\[ \\frac{dAC(q)}{dq} = -\\frac{F+VC(q)}{q^2} + \\frac{1}{q}.\\frac{dV(q)}{dq} \\] which can be rewritten:\n\\[ \\frac{dAC(q)}{dq} = \\frac{1}{q} (\\frac{dV(q)}{dq} -AC(q)) = \\frac{MC(q) - AC(q) }{q} \\]\n  When the marginal costs is lower than the average cost, the average cost curve is decreasing. When the marginal cost equals the average cost the average cost curve is flat (and at its lowest value) and when the marginal cost is higher than the average cost, the curve is increasing.\nThe optimum corresponds to \\( AC(q) = MC(q) \\).\nEconomies of Scale In many industries, average unit costs tend to decrease with the production volume (at least until a certain production threshold). This is for instance the case when the fixed costs are high relative to variable costs (the amortization of fixed costs can be spread over more units).\n  The production process for a specific good or service exhibits economies of scale over a range of output when average cost (i.e. cost per unit of output) declines over that range.\n Informally when there are economies of scale and scope bigger is better [Besanko]\n Economies of scale refer to the advantages that flow from producing a larger output at a given point in time: i.e. the ability to perform an activity at a lower unit cost when it is performed on a larger scale at a particular point in time. [Besanko]\n The area where marginal costs (the incremental costs of producing one more item) are less than average costs brings up economies of scale (aka increasing returns). A firm has a strong incentive to increase its production level within the area of increasing returns (the higher the production level, the lower the unit costs).\nThe smallest quantity for which economies of scale are exhausted (i.e. where the constant return area starts ) is named the minimum efficient scale\nHowever, if the firm continues to increase its production level, sooner or later it will hit the area of decreasing returns and starts to generate diseconomies of scale (for instance because the new production level would require an additional facility which would increase fix costs).\nMulti-business firms may enjoy economies of scope when some inputs (procured parts, production activities) are used for several pro- ducts. In such a case the cumulated production (of all such products) is taken into account to compute unit costs (average total cost per unit).\nThe existence of economies of scope between two different businesses may underpin some corporate advantage. Owning the two businesses creates value in addition to the intrinsic value of each business taken in isolation.\nWhen an average cost curve is L-shaped, costs decrease up to the minimum efficient scale of production and remain stable beyond.\nExample with linear variable costs\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume that the variable cost is a linear function, i.e. \\( VC(q) = a.q \\).\nThe total cost is \\( TC(q) = FC + a.q \\) and the average cost is \\( AC(q) = \\frac{FC}{q} + a \\).\nThe bigger the quantity \\( q \\) produced, the smaller the average cost (for an infinite quantity \\( AC(q) \\approx a\\))\nIn that case, the marginal cost is constant \\( MC(q) = \\frac{VC(q)}{q} = a \\) and the average cost is always decreasing. The average costs decreases when q increases as the fix part becomes more and more diluted.\nExample with more complex variable costs\nThis time let\u0026rsquo;s assume that the variable cost is a more complex function \\( VC(q) = a.q + b.q^2 \\). There is still a linear part but also a quadratic element \\( bq^2\\).\nThe total cost is \\( TC(q) = FC + a.q + b.q^2 \\) and the average cost is \\( AC(q) = \\frac{FC}{q} + a + b.q \\). The marginal cost is \\( MC(q) = a + 2b. q \\).\nThe optimum corresponds to:\n\\( AC(q) = MC(q) \\)\ni.e. \\( \\frac{FC}{q} + a + b.q = a + 2b.q\\)\ni.e. \\( \\frac{FC}{q} = b.q\\)\ni.e. \\( q_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{FC}{b}}\\)\nThe average cost decreases until the quantity reaches \\( q_0 \\) and then starts to grow.\nReasons for economies of scale\n Spreading of fixed costs fixed costs derive from factors cannot be scaled down below a certain size (e.g. factories, machine). Fixed-costs also include Advertising, Research \u0026amp; Development costs and set-up costs (i.e. expenditures before any revenues). In many production processes, production capacity is proportional to the volume whereas total cost is proportional to the surface area.\n Economies of density arise when the number of customers increase in a geographic area. Economies of density also applies to all kind of network (telecommunication, airline hub, digital platform).\n Purchasing Power most suppliers give discounts based on quantities purchased\n Inventories firms carry inventory to mitigate the risk of production disruption (e.g. despite a machine being out of service, the full process must continue to run while the machine is being repaired). The higher the production level, the lower the ratio of inventory (law of big numbers).\n  Reasons for diseconomies of scale\n Increasing production (aka production rate) usually is not without problem. As the machines are more loaded they are more prone to failures which disrupts production and entails additional costs (non quality, scrapping, additional lead time, \u0026hellip;). More workers also means that more people are needed to coordinate, plan and lead (i.e. additional overhead, bureaucracy costs).\n When production continues to grow, the fixed assets (e.g. machinery, plants, warehouses, \u0026hellip;) will reach their limit. Increasing any further production will require increasing capacity and therefore fixed costs.\n Labor Cost usually grows with larger firms as they usually offer higher compensation and benefits (wages, bonuses, work council). However it is noteworthy that worker turnover is often lower at larger firms (which reduces the one-off costs of hiring and training new recruits).\n  Economies of Scope The total cost of producing simultaneously \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) is less than the cumulative cost of producing the two procuts separately.\nEconomies of scope exist if the firm achieves savings as it increases the variety of goods and services it produces [Besanko]\n \\( TC(Q_x, Q_y) \u0026lt; TC(Q_x,0) + TC(0, Q_y) \\)\nExperience curve In many industries, significant productivity efficiency and improvement are gained with the cumulated level of production. Please note that economies of scale are driven by the level of production within a period (typically the year) whereas the experience effect is linked to the cumulated production level (independently of any time reference).\nThe learning curve (or experience curve) refers to advantages that flow from accumulating experience and know-how overtime: the reduction in unit costs due to accumulating experience over time, independently of the current scale of operation. [Besanko]\n The effect experience can be due to several factors:\n Labour efficiency (learning by doing, getting more confident, etc)\n Standardization, method \u0026amp; process improvement\n Better automation, product redesign\n  In industries where the experience effect is important (for a typical firm, doubling cumulative output reduces average costs by 20%), players will seek to reach the highest cumulated production as quick as they can. They will therefore try to extend their market shares. A firm that can significantly benefit from learning, will often ramp-up production faster to gain from experience quicker.\n  When growth is limited, the industry structure becomes rigid (zero sum games between the players). Players will therefore seek to benefit as much as they can from any market growth (e.g. acquiring new market shares) so that they are in the most favorable situation (cost-wise) when market gets rigid. This is even more crucial in industries where products are highly standardized (commoditization) where price is the only source of differentiation.\nExperience effect equation\nBruce Henderson (who founded the Boston Consulting Group) had noted that the relative decrease of certain variable costs was proportional to the relative increase in cumulated production â in other words the decrease of costs in percentage is proportional to the increase in percentage of the cumulated production.\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta C(q)}{C(q)} = -k . \\frac{ \\Delta q}{q} \\]\nThis is equivalent to say that when the production doubles ( \\( \\Delta q = 2 q \\) ), the variable cost is divided by a constant factor ( \\( \\Delta C(q) = -2k. C(q) \\) ).\n This relationship was probably first quantified in 1936 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the United States, where it was determined that every time total aircraft production doubled, the required labour time decreased by 10 to 15 percent. Subsequent empirical studies from other industries have yielded different values ranging from only a couple of percentages up to 30%, but in most cases it is a constant percentage: It did not vary at different scales of operation. The Learning Curve model posits that for each doubling of the total quantity of items produced, costs decrease by a fixed proportion. [wikipedia]\n The experience effect is represented by the differential equation: \\( \\frac{ dC(q)}{C(q)} = -k . \\frac{ dq}{q} \\), can be solved as \\( ln(C(q)) = -kln(q) + C_0 \\).\nThis then gives \\( C(q) = \\alpha . q^{-k} \\).\nIf \\( q = n \\), the cost of producing the nth unit is \\( C_n = \\alpha . n^{-k} \\).\nAs \\( C_n = \\alpha . 1^{-k} = \\alpha \\), then\n\\[ C_n = C_1 . n^{-k} \\]\nThe unit costs of the nth unit is linked to the unit costs of the first unit. k is a constant (elasticity of costs with regard to output), specific of the industry. One can check that when the cumulated production doubles \\( C_{2n} = C_1 .(2n)^{-k} = C_1n^{-k}. 2^{-k} = C_n. 2^{-k}\\).\nLearning curve when economies of scale are absent\nWhen economies of scale are absent (or when a firm operate beyond the minimum efficient threshold) the average cost function is an horizontal line ( \\( AC(q) = AC_1 \\)). The experience effect can shit the average cost function. For instance when the cumulative production doubles then the average cost function becomes an other horizontal line ( \\( AC(q) = AC_2 \\) with \\( AC_1 \u0026lt; AC_2 \\) ).\nThe Five-Forces Framework This famous framework (\u0026nbsp; [Porter79] [Porter08a] \u0026nbsp;) is a tool to analyze the structure of an industry, to describe the intensity of competition and to understand the origin of its long-term profitability level. Porter’s decisive contribution with the Five-Forces framework is in recognizing profitability is not only influenced by the rivalry between direct competitors.\n  The objective of the analysis is therefore two-fold : on the one hand it delineates the industry and points out its dynamic (what are the long-run performance drivers); on the other, it pinpoints the \u0026ldquo;forces\u0026rdquo; that most influence the profitability so that an industry player can seek to fight against these forces and/or shape them to its advantage\nA 5-Forces analysis will typically seek to address aspects such as :\n what industries to enter (respectively to exit) ?\n what influence can be exerted ?\n How are competitors differently affected by changes in the industry (e.g. raising barriers by increasing investment spending)\n  An industry is defined as a group of firms making a similar type of product or employing a similar set of value-adding processes or resources.\n More technically, industries can be defined as groups of firms with low cross-price elasticity: i.e. price evolution within one group has small or no impact on the demand for goods in the other groups. For instance, an increase in coffee price does not affect postal services prices.\nAccording to Porter, the configuration of the five forces is specific to each industry and rather stable over time.\nMarket Definition \u0026laquo; One cannot analyze competition without first identifying the competitors and competitors are the firms whose strategic choices directly affect one another.\u0026raquo; (\u0026nbsp; [Besanko13] \u0026nbsp;) Antitrust agencies such as the DoJ (Department of Justice) in the US, the EC (European Commission) in the EU or the JFTC (Japan Fair Trade Commission) seek to limit anticompetitive conducts and to prevent situations where firms might abuse their market power.\nAccording to the DOJ (SSNIP criterion), a market is well defined and all the competitors within it are identified if a merger among them would lead to a Small but Significant (typically 5%) Non-transitory (at least for one year) Increase in Price.\n Besanko provides the example of an hypothetical merger between Audi and Mercedes. Defining the market as German Luxury Cars would limit the players to Audi, Mercedes \u0026amp; BMW. A merger between two of these players would translate into significant market concentration (it would reduce the number of players to 2, down from 3). However, if the market is defined as All luxury cars additional players such as Lexus, Infiniti, Jaguar should be considered as well. The SSNIP provides means to determine which market definition is the closest to reality. If by merging, Audi and Mercedes could raise their prices by at least 5% then it would be the sign that they face little competition from non-German brands, otherwise the larger market definition applies.\nThe Five forces Barney (\u0026nbsp; [Barney91] \u0026nbsp;) underlines that the market-view of the firm focuses on competitive imperfections in product markets to explain persistent differences in firm performance.\nThe 5-forces framework is one of the most prominent tools to underline such imperfection and identify opportunities to earn superior returns. However, whether a firm can gain a competitive advantage doesn’t depend solely on strategies that create competitive imperfections in product markets but as well on the total cost of implementing these strategies (which is determined by the competitiveness of the strategic factors).\nThis section mainly draws from Porter’s articles.\nThe Five Forces Framework (\u0026nbsp; [Porter79] [Porter08a] \u0026nbsp;) is a tool to analyze the structure of an industry, that is to describe the intensity of competition and to understand the origin of its long-term profitability level.\n «With the ‘Five Forces’, my goal has been to develop rigorous and useful frameworks that efficiently bridge the gap between theory and practice » – [Porter, 2008b].\n Porter’s decisive contribution with the Five-Forces framework is in recognizing profitability is not only influenced by the rivalry between direct competitors. According to him, the configuration of the five forces is specific to each industry. The objective of the analysis is therefore two-fold: i) it delineates the industry and points out its dynamic (what are the long-run performance drivers) and ii) it pinpoints the \u0026ldquo;forces\u0026rdquo; that most influence the profitability so that an industry player can seek to fight against these forces and/or shape them to its advantage.\n «In essence, the job of the strategist is to understand and cope with competition. Competition for profits goes beyond established industry rivals to include four other competitive forces as well : customers, suppliers, potential entrants and substitute products. The extended rivalry that results from all five forces defines an industry’s structure and shapes the nature of competitive interaction within an industry. [\u0026hellip;] The point of industry analysis is not to declare the industry attractive or unattractive but to understand the underpinning s of competition and root cause of profitability » – [Porter,1979].\n Companies in the competitive field should not be defined in terms of product types, but rather in terms of the customers needs they served. This encourages decision maker to more precisely identify new entrant / substitutes and as well broaden the potential growth opportunities spectrum.\nCompetition forces are not specific to any specific firm but on the contrary, apply identically to all the firms in the industry. According to the Market-Based paradigm the structure of an industry underpins attractiveness, as it is the sole determinant of mid to long-term profitability.\n Intense forces will tend to reduce industry profitability and no firm will earn attractive returns. By contrast, when forces are softer, players can generate profit in excess to their cost of capital. The five forces framework helps assessing the market Power.\nThe market power of a firm is its capability to establish prices that exceed their marginal costs and therefore generate a sustainable higher performance.\n An industry analysis should include quantitative elements as much as possible: „the effects of the forces are directly tied to the income statements and balance sheet of industry participants” ([Porter, 1998]). The analysis should not be limited to drawing the static picture of current forces but should also seek to anticipate shifts in each force and forecast how it might trigger reactions in the other.\nFive forces - Rivalry among incumbent players Rivalry, the most obvious form of competition, can take many different forms: advertising campaigns, pricing, promotion and special offers, enhanced services, etc. How much rivalry impacts an industry’s profitability depends on the intensity with which firms compete but also on the basis on which they compete. Rivalry intensity is higher if:\n Many competitors usually increase rivalry. Indeed, establishing practices advantageous for the industry (as a whole) requires either a strong leader or a small group of competitors (oligopoly). Small number of players facilitate collusive behavior (a collusive behavior is a strategic anticipation and not an explicit agreements between firms - collusion- which is usually forbidden by antitrust laws). By contrast, the risk of war price increases with the number of similar players and/or when they all are of similar size and power.\n Competitor diversity measured by the degree of integration, diversification, geographical location etc. The more similar the players the more likely collusive behavior. Conversely dissimilar firms are likely to seek to adopt more innovative and aggressive behavior, which will impact industry profitability.\n Industry growth is limited (i.e.the industry is mature r declining). Players can only grow their market shares at the expense of the others (zero sum game). In non-mature markets, some players may also reduce unilaterally their prices and seek to capture big market share to be well positioned when the market gets mature.\n Exit barriers are high for instance there are specific assets or significant sunk costs – as firms can barely escape the industry, they will try to maintain themselves in the industry (in the hope of an economic recovery) as long as their losses are less than the exit costs. This usually creates overcapacity and drives price down for all players even the healthier.\n Some players have non-economic goals (e.g.image, employment, family owned business, CEO’s ego and prestige). Such high commitment to the business can lead to non-rational actions and decisions and become detrimental to the complete industry.\n Firms cannot read each other’s signal for instance due to a lack of familiarity with each other, cultural difference, unclear goals, diverse approaches to competing.\n    Rivalry can occur on various factors. However it is higher if it focuses on price only when:\n Little differentiation low customer loyalty (no brand value, the image or reputation of the vendor makes no difference), the products and/or services are perceived as equivalent (commoditization: the goods are becoming simple commodities in the eyes of the consumers), buyers are facing little switching costs when changing providers.\n Fix costs are high and marginal costs are low volume becomes a major strategic parameter (economies of scale) and therefore all the players are tempted to reduce their price with the objective to i) capture more market share, ii) reduce their unit costs and iii) restore their long-term profit.\n Capacity must be expanded in large increments to avoid diseconomies of scale (e.g. new plant set-up). As a result, production increase far exceeds demand and overcapacity drives profitability down for the complete industry.\n Perishable product product that cannot get stocked (e.g.fresh vegetables) or goods that will soon get obsoleted (high tech products) or for which unsold capacity can’t be recovered (e.g. consultant or physician time, airline seat on a particular flight). Again, overcapacity will drive profitability down for all the players.\n  When competition apply on attributes other than price (e.g. enhance feature, better quality, complementary services), then the impact on industry profitability is more limited. Indeed, the enhancement usually translates into a higher perceived value which allows a price premium. It also raises entry barriers and reduces the threat of entry / threat of substitutes.\nRivalry among competitor relates to competition between firms that are already members of the industry. In large industry with many players, rivalry can be homogeneous (all players compete on similar attributes) or segmented (sub-groups compete on different attributes). To the extreme (perfect competition) no player can generate any profit in excess to its opportunity cost. In other words, the industry doesn’t generate any economic return.\nFive forces - Threat to entry Potential new entrants are firms that despite not being part of the industry yet, are threatening to enter and can be seen as latent players.\nIncumbents have an incentive not to increase too much industry performance (i.e. their profit) as otherwise additional players will join and seek to grab market share, which would put pressure on price and elevate costs (e.g. increased R\u0026amp;D, marketing expenditure, etc).\nPotential new entrants already established in other industries are even more threatening as they may leverage their existing capabilities and capital to shake up existing competition. Incumbents can deter new entrants by keeping their prices at rather lower levels and continuing to innovate and invest (which also reduce profit).\nCompetition authorities (anti-trust) consider that some markets (coined contestable markets by economists) are characterized by competitive equilibria despite being served by a very small number of players. In other words, the threat of entry is sufficient to cap profit (i.e. the part of value captured from customers).\n  Barriers to entry increase with:\n Supplier-side economies of scale – firms that produce higher volume enjoy lower unit costs (fixed costs are averaged on more units, more efficient production processes \u0026amp; equipment, better terms \u0026amp; conditions from the supply base). A new entrant may either chose to produce a limited volume (and face far higher unit costs, which affects profit) or enter the industry directly with a large production volume (and experience significant overcapacity for a while).\n Network-effect (aka externalities, Buyer-side economies of scale) were the willingness to pay of buyers increase with the number of users of the good.\n Switching costs that a firm may incur (usually up-front, sunk costs) when moving from the installed supplier to a new one. This barrier is reduced for fast growing markets as incremental customer (i.e. new customers) don’t face switching cost.\n Investment needs to enter the industry (eg.fix assets: plants, equipment or working capital: inventory build up, customer credit or SG\u0026amp;A costs: development, advertising, etc) may be high. While large established firms may have both the willingness and financial capabilities to enter the industry, huge capital requirements is likely to reduce the number of prospective entrants. However, if the returns of the industry are attractive and are expected to remain so, potentially any new entrant can raise the funds from the capital market.\n Other cost advantage that incumbents may enjoy independently of their production volume (Ricardo rents). The may for instance, benefit from better access to key suppliers, protected patents, attractive geographic position, established brand recognition and reputation. In such a situation replicating the industry’s cost structure can be very challenging. However new entrant may decide to alter the current business model to counter the advantage of the entrenched players.\n Market access/distribution channels the more limited the wholesale or retail channels, the tougher the entry. Nevertheless, new entrant may decide to short-circuit existing distribution channels and create their own.\n Regulation and government policies can limit (e.g.licensing requirements, patents, intellectual property rights), forbid (e.g. restriction on foreign investment) or on the contrary, incentivize entries (subsidies, public R\u0026amp;D investments).\n Expected retaliation How incumbents would respond to a new player entering the industry can also be a barrier to entry, provided that incumbents are committed to defending their market and let it know (e.g. public statement, historical behavior). The more available resources (e.g. cash) the stronger the resistance (war price, quality increase, advertising) and higher the entry barrier.\n  The threat of entry relates to the (potential) competition between a firm (the new entrant) and all incumbents players. If the threat materializes it impacts the market shares of entrenched players. High barriers to entry prevent additional players to join an industry. From the perspective of incumbents, barriers to entry protect the industry and protect profitability. Incumbents (especially in concentrated industries) will seek to in- crease barriers, for instance through contractual set-up (exclusivity, franchise, alliances) and lobbying actions.\n «If entry barriers are low and new comers expect little retaliation from entrenched competitors, the threat of entry is high and industry profitability is therefore moderate» – [Porter, 2008b].\n Incumbents will be particularly successful at strengthening entry barriers when:\n They can mobilize significant capital resources (cash, credit access)\n They are concentrated and can lock-in suppliers and customers\n The industry is mature with low growth   Five forces - Threat of Substitutes A substitute is a product or service that would be considered by customers as equivalent to the industry’s products. It has comparable functional attributes but is often based on different technologies (e.g. domestic flights vs. high-speed train, video rental shop vs internet video on demand).\nIncumbents may fail to identify early enough substitutes, as they can be very different from the products currently offered by the industry (shop-around- the-corner vs amazon). An industry with little substitutes (rigid demand) is structurally more profitable.\nSubstitutes may emerge through technological innovations (e.g. wide deployment of the Internet), performance improvements of existing technologies (PC replacing mainframes), breakthroughs in cost structure, integration of various functions in a single product.\nAn industry will seek to reduce the threat of substitutes by lowering its own prices and/or increasing the product’s quality and features (so that customers will continue to prefer the industry’s product).\n  The threat of substitutes is higher if:\n Attractive price performance trade off can be offered, for instance through proposing different value-proposition (usually less sophisticated but much cheaper product) and increase the utility of some buyer groups.\n Low switching cost are associated with current products - i.e.there is little or no network-effect and customer loyalty is low.\n Price sensitive customers i.e. price-elasticity of demand is high - customers will tend to switch to any alternative, provided that price can be made more attractive.\n   «Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along, that changes everything.

Apple is going to revolutionize the Phone. » – Steve Jobs, 2007.\n Five forces - Supplier / Buyer Power These two forces depict how the participants that belong to the same value system (aka supply chain) can grab value. They have convergent interest in increasing the total created value, however they all seek to capture more of the value for themselves. This is clearly a zero sum game what one side wins, the other side looses.\nIf suppliers (including suppliers of labour usually represented by their unions) increase their transfer price, then industry profitability is likely to decline, except if industry participants can pass on the increase to their own customers. The reasoning that applies between suppliers and industry players, also applies between industry players and their customers.\n  A supplier group is more powerful if:\n It is more concentrated than the industry is sells to (in other words, the most concentrated end has more power).\n It derives limited revenues from the industry and has a well balanced portfolio of customers. The more dependent of the industry the suppliers, the less market power.\n It offers highly differentiated products and/or services - commodization on the contrary leads to reduced power.\n It can credibly integrate forward into the industry. Powerful customers can reduce industry profitability by driving prices down, requesting enhanced quality and/or services or playing industry participants\n  A customer group has more leverage if:\n They purchase high volumes relative to the size of a typical industry participant,\n Products are standardized and/or undifferentiated (commoditization) or they enter into the production of an end-product and their quality has little impact on the quality of the end product. In such a situation buyers will face many potential suppliers, which highly increases their bargaining power. By contrast, if the inputs from a vendor are determinant (quality, performance, specific knowledge) then buyers will become less price sensitive and their willingness to pay will increase (until they find a substitute).\n Limited switching costs if any, when a customer changes its provider (transaction costs, transfer of work, risks).\n Integration threat Customers can credibly integrate backward into the industry\n  Customer groups will have incentives to use their market power if their profitability is low and/or they are suffering cash issues or if the product/service they procure:\n represents a significant part of their cost structure Buyers are more price-sensitive for the items that represent a high portion of their costs. By contrast, ’small items’ usually enjoy relatively better conditions.\n doesn’t impacts the quality of their own products Buyers view the product/service as a commodity and are ready to switch to a new supplier if necessary.\n  Market Power vs Negotiation Power Market power is a characteristic of an industry as a whole (and applies equally to all players in that industry). It corresponds to the transfer of economic rents among the various stages of the production process (from raw material to end product). Market power reflects the ability of industry players to influence pricing mechanisms, raise price above marginal cost and earn a positive profit. Adopting collusive behavior and/or limiting supply are typical behaviors that signal market power. Market power is also linked to the elasticity of the demand curve. By contrast to market power, negotiation power is specific to a given player (may vary across the various players of a same industry). It reflects the ability of the player to impose its preferences to its eco-system. For instance, large players will more easily obtain good conditions from their suppliers or retailers.\nAdditional Considerations about costs Sunk costs, Avoidable costs One of the key principle of micro-economics is that when a firm is facing a decision, past decisions cannot be undone and only that costs that the decision affects should be considered.\nSunk costs are those costs that are already incurred and cannot be recovered (not matter what). Once incurred they should be ignored in any future decision. Avoidable costs are those costs that can be recovered.\n Ignoring sunk costs leads to a frequent fallacy. Assume that you launch the development of a product under the assumptions that it will cost 10 million. As you have already spent 8 million, a direct competitor unveils a similar product which cuts your addressable market by two. The 8 million already spent are sunk costs (assuming that what has been done cannot be re-used for any other purpose). So the decision to continue or stop should only be based on comparing the new market perspective with the 2 million investment that are still required to complete the development (and not the initial 10).\n It is important to recognize that not all fixed costs are sunk costs. If you acquire an office building to host your headquarters you always have the option to re-sell it later (not necessarily at the same price though). By contrast, if you build rail tracks between two of your factories, it is very likely that associated investment are sunk costs.\nIdentifying Sunk costs is key to understand the structure of an industry and entry / exit decisions. More globally it is highly advisable to recognize before committing to any large expense what will be sunk cost and what will be avoidable cost.\nEconomic vs Accounting costs Accounting tend to recognize three main types of costs: direct costs (aka Cost of Good Sold), indirect costs (aka Sales, General Management \u0026amp; Administration) and Amortization \u0026amp; Depreciation.\nAccounting statements such as the balance sheet and income statement are aimed at external audience (tax authorities, lenders, shareholders \u0026amp; investors). Accounting numbers are based on historical costs. For instance, to assess the value of an inventory of raw material, accounting will consider the (weighted average) price at which it has been purchased.\nBusiness decisions (starting with strategy related decisions) however should be based on economic costs (i.e.take into account opportunity costs). In the example above, the value of an inventory is the price at which it could be sold on the market (regardless of the price at which it had been purchased by the firm).\nWe will see in the Value Equation section that to attract investors, a firm must generate a return that is at least as large as the return they could have received from the best investment of similar risk.\nPrice elasticity of demand According to the law of demand (one of the most fundamental principle in micro-economics) the overall quantity of a good that consumers are ready to buy is a function of the price of the good. The higher the price the less quantity is sold.\nWhen a firm changes its pricing policy (for instance increases the price) it will impact its addressable market (for instance sell less), its average cost and its profit. While this principle applies to all industries the magnitude of the effect is highly variable from one good to the next (and depends usually as well on the level output).\nThe elasticity of demand measures the sensitivity of the effect. It is defined as the variation of demand relatively to the variation of price.\n\\[ \\epsilon = - \\frac{\\frac{dq}{q}}{\\frac{dP(q)}{P(q)}}\\]\nIf \\( \\epsilon \\) is less than 1, the demand is inelastic. A classical example is fuel (gasoline) with elasticity around 0.1 to 0.2 - which means that even when fuel price double, the total quantity is reduced by around 30%. At the extreme when \\( \\epsilon \\) is null, the demand is totally inelastic (the quantity sold remains identical no matter the price level).\nIf \\( \\epsilon \\) is more than 1, the demand is elastic.\nPrice elasticity can be assessed numerically (that typically what econometrics an do). Qualitatively a product is more price-sensitive (elastic) when i) differentiation compared is limited and competitors\u0026rsquo; price are easily accessible, ii) the price of the product represents a large chunk of the buyer\u0026rsquo;s expenditure or budget. Conversely a product is less elastic when i) comparison among competing or substitute products is difficult or costly, ii) switching costs are high, iii) the product is a complement to an other product that has very high switching costs.\nIn a highly competitive market, if one firm only changes their price (and their rivals don\u0026rsquo;t match that new price) then it is likely that most of the demand will shift to the firms with the lowest price.\nIn a situation of perfect competition, a firm has no impact on the market price (firms are price takers) and the demand curve that see each firm is constant (an horizontal line at the market price \\( P = P^* \\)). In that case price elasticity is infinite.\nTOTAL and MARGINAL REVENUE The total revenue function of a firm denotes the revenue captured by the firm as a function of its level of production \\( q \\). The total revenue equals the quantity times the price for that quantity (demand curve).\n\\[R(q) = P(q) * q \\]\nThe marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue function and represent the addition revenue derived from selling one additional unit.\n\\[ \\frac{dR(q)}{dq} = \\frac{dP(q)}{dq} * q + P(q) = P(q) * [ \\frac{dP(q)}{P}* \\frac{q}{dq} + 1 ] \\] \\[ \\frac{dR(q)}{dq} = P(q) * ( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} ) \\]\nIt follows that if demand is inelastic, ( i.e \\( \\epsilon \\) is less than 1) then \\( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\) is more than 1, which entails that \\( ( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} ) \\) is negative and therefore the total revenue decreases.\n"

	"content": " Buy Borrow Build M\u0026amp;A are sometimes launched without any sound rationale. This is often viewed as ’the one way’ whereas a more flexible approach (alliance, commercial relationship) would bear more promices. „CEOs suffer from blind spots about alternatives ways of undertaking important changes - Mergers and acquisitions often create more headline than value” (L. Capron).\n  Laurence Capron has designed this framework to guide companies and help them select the appropriated growth option. Indeed she stresses that many firms expect acquisitions to accelerate their growth, but executives often turn to them for wrong reasons:\n Self-interest M\u0026amp;A feed managers’ egos, reputations and empire building aspiration. Planning a large acquisition may also mask the poor performance of their current portfolio. Managers often abuse M\u0026amp;A because of incentive systems and short term focus on earning per share over long- term value creation.\n Over commitment M\u0026amp;A is often the preferred mode of growth regardless of the context. In addition, managers tend to focus on a particular target that first triggers their interest, even before performing a comprehensive analysis. A good approach to weight the early enthusiasm is to establish red and green teams, in charge of building the positive and negative case respectively. Staff members should take turns serving on red teams so that no one become type-cast.\n Blocking strategy use acquisition to stop competition from purchasing a target, according to the famous if we don’t do it someone else will. The buyer always incurs the costs of acquiring and integrating the target (and M\u0026amp;A always bring unanticipated roadblocks and expenses). Competitors can nearly always find alternatives.\n    A continuum of Growth options In real life the distinction between the three options are not as sharp as it may seem. In addition, depending from the perspective (i.e. legal ) moves may be interpreted differently.\n  Strategic alliances The term Strategic Alliance corresponds to a broad concept that encompasses: a variety of situations where two or more companies set a formal or informal agreement to pursue a join \u0026amp; shared objective.\nAn alliance is a form of collaboration where each partner contribute strategic capabilities (assets, knowledge, reputation) to a project.\nAn alliance can be established through\n non-equity alliance partners remain independent legal entities. A contract defines the roles and responsibilities of the parties toward a join objective.\n equity ownership partners own stakes in each other (e.g. Renault owns 43,4% of Nissan and Nissan owns 15% of Renault). In addition partners will have representatives to each other board of directors. Not all cross shareholding correspond to equity alliances. Indeed an alliance requires the will to collaborate to a join project.\n joint venture a new independent company is established and co-owned by the partners.JV are both a form of collaboration and a form of M\u0026amp;A. Sometimes, JV are not considered strategic alliances as resources are pooled in a separate new legal entity\n    Strategic alliances can be characterized according to whether or not partners operate in the same industry:\n horizontal strategic alliance are formed by companies active in the same business area (e.g. Nissan Renault, Airline alliance)\n vertical alliance collaboration between upstream and downstream players in the same value chain.\n intersectional alliance partners are operating in different markets and control very different resources and competences. They were not connected by a vertical chain or worked in the same business area.\n  Likewise strategic alliance can be characterized according to the nature of the strategic objective that triggers collaboration:\n Coalition based alliances partners –usually from the same industry – seek to achieve global presence, improve their market position and increase their market power compared to other competitors.\n Co-specialization alliances partners combine their complementary expertise to develop and market new product / services.\n Learning alliances partners join forces to develop new technologies or solve technical issues.\n  By and large, collaborations cover one or more of the following purposes:\n Technology development improve technology or develop know-how.\n Operations \u0026amp; Logistics build economies of scope / scale.\n Marketing \u0026amp; Sales distribution infrastructure, affiliate marketing, franchise, licensing.\n  Yoshino and Rangan (\u0026nbsp; [Yoshin95] \u0026nbsp;) consider that strategic alliances are significantly influenced by the Extent of organizational interaction (how much must the partners interact to have the alliance work effectively) and conflict potential among the alliance partners (particularly if partners are also competitors in the market).\nFour situations may arise:\n Pro-competitive Alliances corresponds to low interaction and low conflict. It typically reflects a relationship between a manufacturer and its sup- pliers or distributors.\n Non competitive Alliances are characterized by high interaction and low conflict. They are formed between the companies that but do not consider each other as rivals (even if they operate in the same industry) for the purpose of the alliance. Geographical expansions often rely upon such alliances.\n Competitive Alliances are characterized by high interaction and high conflict. Partners perceive each other as rivals. Technology development, market access or offsets are typical reasons for establishing such alliances\n Pre-competitive Alliance corresponds to a situation with low interaction and high conflict. Typically it can be a partnership between firms from different, unrelated industries who join forces towards the development of a new product or technology.\n  Acquisitions M\u0026amp;A becomes the right pathway when i) the firm has identified and made explicit the strategic rationale for the move and ii) all alternatives options have been ruled out (e.g. the firm lacks the internal skills and resources to build in- house and as no effective contractual relationship can be established with a partner then a full control over the partner is required).\n  There are three main ’flavors’ of resource combinations that can be brought by M\u0026amp;A:\n Exploitation the acquired company brings resources that complement and strengthen the core domain of the firm, which enhance its existing activities in its established markets\n Extension the acquired company facilitates the development into new markets (geographic, new customer groups, etc) or provides additional products / services that can be offered to existing customers.\n Exploration the acquired company allows exploring new market-spaces, potentially through disruptive technologies, products or business models. When carefully chosen, priced and executed, M\u0026amp;A help firms create value by providing access to new technologies, exploiting learning opportunities, meeting customers’ needs, exploiting economies of scale or restructuring industry capacity.\n  "

	"content": " Matrices are very often associated with the practice of strategy. A good strategist would have to produce nice looking charts and arrays from which the purpose a firm and key management actions can be derived and illustrated. Reality has become a bit different though. Nowadays, people have learned to become cautious - even sometimes skeptical - when they see nice looking charts.\n  It is however important to recognize the most common matrices and understand what they represent (and may be even more important what they don’t represent).\nA matrix can be used to visualize the current status of a firm’s portfolio. A two- axes matrix is a mean of representation: it projects more than two dimensions on a plane. Strategy matrices, however, are also often used as prescription tools : the various quadrants of the matrix call for different management actions. It is then absolutely paramount to understand what are the underlying assumptions that drive such recommendations. Applying a corpus of recommendations to a situation that doesn’t meet the pre-requisite or doesn’t correspond to the situation for which the tool was designed, can lead to very counter productive decisions.\nBCG Matrix The Growth Share chart (aka BCG Matrix) was created by Bruce Henderson (the founder of the Boston Consulting Group) in the early 70’s.\nThe chart relies on two axes : the relative market share and the growth rate of the market. It is noteworthy that while the market share can be computed from current data (although it is not always easy to figure out the revenues generated by competitors) the (future) growth of the market is more subjective (should the growth remain stable? increase? decrease? On what rationale?).\nThe focus with this tool is on cash (profit) and on ensuring the proper identification / balance of cash generating vs. cash consuming activities.\n  The two major underlying assumptions are that\n Unit costs are mainly driven by economies of scale. Hence the competitor that controls the bigger volume can enjoy lower production costs and better return. Achieving high volumes (compared to the industry) is one of the main objectives of a firm.\n There exist high growing markets with sustainable demand. As competition is weaker on growing markets - see section on the 5 forces - firms will focus such markets and seek to grow quicker than competition.\n  That was possibly a good approximation of the economic conditions in the early 70’s, however, this is no longer the case in many countries / many industries.\nTypical prescriptions are associated with the four quadrants that each represents a specific category of product / activities:\n Cash Cow are products in slow-growing markets for which the firm has high market shares. Such markets are assumed to be mature (they grew and now are stable or even starting to decline). Consequently such mar- kets should be unappealing to new entrants. Competition will remain stable or even decrease. The firm has high market share and should enjoy better economies of scale than competition and better returns. In the 70’s that led to the prescription of reducing investments (product, notoriety, advertising) and cashing in all the profit as long as feasible.\n Dog are products in slow-growing markets for which the firm doesn’t have high market share. Again, this is assumed to be a mature, decline market. However as the firm has lower market shares, it is assumed that it suffers higher production costs which degrades its average returns on in- vested capital. Dogs are supposed to be ’end-of-life’ products / activities and the typical prescription is to disengage from these businesses.\n Stars are products in fast-growing markets for which the firm has high market shares. The objective here is to maintain the competitive position so that when the market gets mature, the Star will become Cash Cow. The firm needs to keep investing in the product (technology, production pro- cess, branding, customer loyalty) to maintain its dominant position and sustain the growth rate.\n Question Marks are products in fast-growing markets for which the firm has not (yet) significant market shares. Most products start as Question marks. However not all the products become Stars and if they fail to achieve high market shares before the market get mature, they may turn into Dogs directly.\n  The GE Portfolio Matrix The GE (aka McKinsey) Portfolio matrix is a slightly more sophisticated version of the BCG Growth-Share matrix. It plots Market Attractiveness against Business Strength and usually uses a 3 by 3 grid (low, average, high) rather than a 2 by 2 grid.\n    Composite Index Whereas the BCG matrix uses growth as a measure of market attractiveness and market share as a measure of business strength, the GE matrix can use a vast variety of criteria. It can also either use a simple measurable parameter (e.g. attractiveness can depend on the average return of the industry) or consider a composite index (obtained as the weighted average of several parameters).\n  Composite index are richer (they take into account more elements and are more representative of a complex reality). However, it gets soon very difficult to avoid (very) subjective assessments.\nThe ADL matrix The ADL matrix is also known as the product life cycle portfolio matrix. It is similar to the BCG and GE matrix but put the emphasis on the life cycle of the industry / product.\n  "

The same story will then be told again to all the stakeholders to get the strategy executed. Furthermore, several dominant figures in the field of strategic management, now consider that this story – the core strategic intend, the company purpose – should be the cornerstone of strategy elaboration.

	"content": " What Strategy for your Strategy? Predictability is not comparable in the oil industry and in the Internet software industry. From this obvious observation, M Reeves, C. Love and Ph Tillmans Reeves et al. (\u0026nbsp; [Reeves12] \u0026nbsp;) derive that companies in very dissimilar competitive environment should be planning and developing their strategies in different ways.\nStrategy-Making must match competitive environment nature The oil industry holds few surprises for planners: factors are well identified and outside any single company’s control, barriers to entry are very high, no one is really in a position to change the game. In game theory terms, the oil industry is a game in complete information. By contrast, the Internet software industry is characterized by new firms suddenly popping up from nowhere. The basis of competition can be fundamentally altered without much warning. In such an environment, competitive advantage comes from reading and responding to signals faster than your rivals.\nThe strategy-making process should match the nature of the competitive environment. Obviously many factors play into strategy formulation, however two characteristics are of prime importance: predictability and malleability.\n Predictability - measures how far in the future and how accurately you can confidently forecast (e.g. demand, performance, competition dynamics, etc..).\n Malleability - measures to what extend you (and your competitors) can influence the industry and market.\n    Four Strategy-making strategies These two characteristics delineate four perspectives each corresponding to its own specific strategy-making strategy.\n Classical - little malleability, good predictability - The influencing factors of the industry you operate in are well known and identified, the competitive environment is very stable. However you barely can change the environment (e.g. due to the atomicity of each firm). The canonical strategy formulation process, as taught in business schools, assumes this very competitive environment. It is not big surprise that most strategy-making frameworks are designed for such a ’classical’ competitive environment. Within the classical perspective a company sets a goal, capitalizing from its capabilities and tries to fortify that position. Strategy aims at optimizing long-term returns and careful planning feeds multi-annual forecasts. Strategy planning hinges upon specific skills and competences – both analytic and quantitative – and usually will be carried out by a dedicated, stand-alone department.\n Adapting - little malleability, very unpredictability - A carefully crafted ’classical’ strategy can become obsolete within months or weeks. In such a volatile competitive environment flexibility and the capability to re- fine/revise plans and targets is what makes the difference. Strategy formulation must then become more agile and experimental. The best bet is to constantly and quickly, produce, rollout and test a variety of products. For instance, ZARA, the Spanish retailer, can design, manufacture and ship new products in less than two weeks. Zara assesses market reaction with small batches and if they prove a hit then ramp-up production. Operations (the capability to quickly react and adapt) is the key success factor when a company is confronted to such a competitive environment. Strategists can no longer work in isolation and on the contrary, must be tightly linked with (or embedded into) operations.\n Shaping - lot of malleability, very unpredictability - this typically corresponds to new, high growth industries with low barriers to entry / high rate of innovations. Demand is very hard to predict and the course of industry can shift radically. A mature but very fragmented industry can also become a shaping environment. The strategy here consists in not trying to plan or adapt (follow) but in trying to shape the unpredictable so that it benefits to the company whatever turns out: „The best way to predict the future is to invent it” (John Scully, Chairman, Apple Computer). A typical approach is to build a complete ecosystem of customers, suppliers, complementors; to create a platform and to set standards and practices.\n Visionary - lot of malleability, very predictability - sometimes not only can the future be predicted and forecast, but a single company have the power to shape the future. A visionary strategy considers that the environment is not a given but on the contrary can be modeled and distorted to its benefit. In 1994, UPS realized that the rising of e-business and online retailers would drive an unprecedented demand for delivery services. UPS had the vision, the means and the will to make the necessary investment ($1 billion a year during several years) and to become what they later called the enablers of global e-commerce. UPS integrated its core package-tracking operations with those of web providers and expanded its global delivery capacity through acquisition. By 2000 UPS had captured in excess of 60% of the e-commerce delivery market.\n  Think [Long and Hard] before you choose A team of researchers (\u0026nbsp; [Lafley12] \u0026nbsp;) has been wondering why does strategic planning consume so many resources and so much time while having so little impact? This would be, according to them, mainly due to strategic planning only faking scientific approach despite apparent rigor and extensive analysis. Therefore they suggest one could escape this pitfall through a seven-step decision process that systematically scans well-articulated possibilities to ensure that different options are looked at, explored and probed, before any choice is made.\nStep1: Frame a choice Conventional strategy planning starts from the issue to be solved (i.e. decreasing revenues) which drives a strong tendency to get very emotional and to invest in analyzing the issues rather than working out solutions. By contrast, the approach should consist in framing the problem as a ’choice’ (for instance by defining mutually exclusive options that could resolve the issue in question). This framing helps strategists conduct stronger analyses and the managers internalize what is truly at stake.\nIn 1990s, Procter \u0026amp; Gamble was eager to become a major player in the global beauty care sector (their objective), still they only controlled small, down-market brands (e.g. Oil of Olay) and only addressing an aging consumer base. Rather than dwelling too much on this weakness, Procter \u0026amp; Gamble formulated two options:\n dramatically transform ’Oil of Olay’ into something comparable to L’Oréal, Clarins, etc, spend billions into acquiring an existing skin care brand  Step2:Generate strategic possibilities Once options are identified, the second step consists in constructing strategic possibilities (including genuinely new ones). A possibility is a ’story’ that describes how a firm might success [how the option can materialize]. It needs to be consistent and ’valid’, however it doesn’t need to be proved at that stage. Any possibility must explicit\n the advantage it aims to achieve or leverage, the scope across which the advantage applies, the activities throughout the value chain that would deliver the intended advantage.  This step should involve a team of people from different backgrounds and expertise while trying to avoid as much as possible people emotionally bond to the ’Status Quo’. Operational managers should take part to the complete exercise, as when planners are different from doers then what gets done is different from what get planned. Several techniques can be mobilized to work out possibilities:\n inside-out possibility generation – start with assets and capabilities and reason outward: what does this company do especially well that parts of the market might value and that might produce profit? outside-in possibility generation – what are the underserved needs? What are the needs that customers find hard to serve? far-outside-in possibility generation - what would it take to become the Google, the Apple or the WallMart of this market?  A good set of possibilities must contain at least one possibility that directly questions the status quo (while being considered as feasible and bringing some interest) and at least one possibility that is far enough from the status quo (even if it is not sure it could be doable and/or safe at all).\nStep3: Specify the conditions for success In practice, this step should make explicit the conditions that need to hold true for the possibilities (identified in step 2) to be a success. This is achieved through producing declarative statements such as for possibility P to succeed, condition X must be true. Where typical conditions encompass: the industry structure, the strategic segments, consumer structure and volume, distribution channel, capabilities, costs, competitors’ likely reactions. (for instance ’Channel partners will support us’).\nWhen the list of conditions is established, it should be screened again to eliminate all the nice to have conditions while keeping the must-have.\nAt that stage one should refrain from being judgmental and/or expressing their opinions about whether a condition is true or not. The only question is whether or not one would advocate for this possibility, provided that all the conditions were true.\nStep4: Identify barriers to choice Once conditions are identified, one must determine which are more likely to hold true. Typically one would ask each teammate to raise their concerns and to rank the conditions by likelihood. More often than not there will be a consensus on most conditions (either that they hold true or that they don’t).\nHowever the group may have contrasted opinions on a few conditions. Pay close attention on these conditions and also on the people who are the most skeptical: they will be the biggest barriers (potentially a valid obstacle in case of problematic possibilities).\nStep5: Design test for barrier conditions Once the key barriers have been identified they must be tested to determine whether they can hold true or not. Several techniques can be mobilized: survey, data crunching and interviews.\nThe teammate who is the most skeptical about a given condition should design and lead the test for that condition, as this person will have the highest standard of proof.\nStep6: Conduct the tests At that stage, all the conditions must be checked according to the test protocols defined at step 5. Probing the conditions in the reverse order of confidence – the lazy’s man approach to choice – often turns out to be the most efficient. Indeed as soon as a condition appears to be false, the associated possibility can be eliminated (and there is no need to further test the conditions that are a prerequisite to that possibility only).\nStep7: Make choice With the possibilities-based approach, making the final decision – that is deciding the strategy – only requires choosing the possibility that remains when all barriers have been identified and tested.\n"

	"content": " Business Case One may argue that preparing business cases does not strictly fall within the scope of strategy, and even less of corporate strategy. There are however at least three reasons for looking at business cases as part of strategy elaboration:\n Value: strategic moves are about generating value. Although value must here be understood in its widest sense, many stakeholders (starting with shareholders) will measure value in terms of the financial impact.\n Investment: strategic moves will also require mobilizing and/or acquiring resources. Financial resources and investments will be under the scrutiny of the Chief Financial Officer, and it is very unlikely that any significant investment can be allowed without a sound financial justification.\n ACID Test: the most common excuse for people who fail to elaborate a business case is \u0026lsquo;it is strategic\u0026rsquo; (meaning it is so important that is doesn\u0026rsquo;t even need to be justified). Likewise it is not uncommon to discover that a supposedly competitive advantage turns out to be undetectable when translated into figures.\n   The goal of business strategy is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of a business, i.e. its future cashflows appropriately discounted for their timing and riskness. (\u0026nbsp; [Puranam16] \u0026nbsp;)    In strategy, the objective of business case is to substantiate the qualitative orientations with quantitative forecasts.\n Figures (usually orders of magnitudes) can then get connected and compared with business-as-usual operations. This chapter briefly presents how to put together a financial business case and introduces some key concepts of Corporate Finance.\nRevenue Streams A business case encompasses two main items: forecasted revenues and forecasted costs. More precisely it consists of a time series of revenues and costs streams. This section addresses revenue aspects while costs are dealt with hereafter.\nA Value Proposition identifies a clear revenue stream, addressing a dedicated customer segment. A firm with a simple business model will offer a single value proposition and address a single customer segment. It will therefore see a single revenue stream. For more complex models each revenue stream (associated to a value proposition / customer group must) must be analyzed separately. The total revenue is then the aggregation of all the streams.\n Revenue Types \nBusiness cases are built from the cash flows (the money actually received or paid) associated to revenue streams and expense streams.\n  It is therefore key to clarify both how much is paid by customers and when payments occur (e.g. periodically subscription vs on-the-go payments).\n Model of the demand \nThe second step consists in forecasting the level of demand for each Value Pro- position / Customer Group (i.e. how much products will be consumed by the customers and when).\n  Models should be kept as simple as possible and should rely on only a very few parameters. The goal is two-fold : evaluate the order of magnitude for the demand and identify the (few) factors that may affect positively or adversely demand.\n Revenue Estimates\nOnce demand \u0026amp; pricing are estimated, it is possible to compute (for each value proposition / customer segment) the forecasted revenues, based on demand (how many units) and on pricing (how much per unit).\n  When there are several value propositions, inflation must be treated consistently (either nominal cash flows or real should be used across all lines). Likewise, in case of international exchanges, foreign currency must be dealt with (usually by converting all currencies into one reference currency).\nThe goal is not to produce complex and sophisticated tables of figures. On the contrary the objective is to have a simple while relevant model of how revenues can develop with time.\n Costs The term Cost has a variety of meanings. Accountants, economists or production engineers have their own (and sometimes conflicting) understanding of what costs are or should be.\n  By and large, costs can be broken down into relevant (for a project), irrelevant, unavoidable (they would be incurred regardless of whether the project is implemented or not) and avoidable.\nA sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and has no alternative use at the time when the decision to implement or not a project is being made. Once spent, sunk costs should not be considered as they are irrelevant to the decision to implement or not additional projects : sunk costs are paid independently of accepting or rejecting the projects. Therefore it should not be accounted in the cash flow stream of the projects. However, for a given project, some of the costs that will be spent only if the project is launched can be sunk costs. In that later case, despite being sunk they should be accounted with the project.\nA good rule of thumb consists in defining a reference situation (aka AS IS situation). The costing of any new project should start from this reference and consider all additional costs as well as all opportunities to reduce existing costs (i.e. make savings). When a sunk cost has already been paid it is lost and cannot be saved (hence cannot been accounted as saving). When a sunk cost is necessary but has not yet been paid it is an additional cost and needs to be accounted as such.\nAccording to economists, an opportunity cost corresponds to the loss of cash inflows due to the project. If a firm uses its own building to host the project, then it waives the revenues it could generate by renting this building. The revenues that the firm could earn if they don\u0026rsquo;t undertake the project (revenues associated to the baseline scenario) should be counted as costs for the project (differential cash flow compared to the reference situation). Likewise, there is an opportunity cost if the project would cause sales erosion on some other businesses of the firm (cannibalization).\nIn finance, the term opportunity cost of capital often refers to the cost of tying up cash into the firm (that is the return expected by the equity and debt holders).\nThe ownership costs correspond to the cost of owning (or lending) an asset plus the cost of using it (maintenance, consumable, insurance, \u0026hellip; ). It is extensively used by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) to justify that a higher price can be compensated by lower usage costs. Obviously computing ownership costs requires a deep understanding of the forecasted usage profile.\nDepending on the product / service, ownership costs may include start-up costs (e.g. customization of the product, integration in the firm environment, initial training, etc..). If the product / service replaces a previous product / services cancellation fees or penalties can be due. A switching cost is the cost, incurred by a customer, to change supplier. The higher this cost, the more difficult for a customer to change supplier. Sometimes suppliers (e.g. cell phone operators) will subsidize customers and reimburse the switching costs (e.g. in exchange for time commitment).\nTransaction costs correspond to all the costs associated with searching, selecting and contracting a product / service. It is a cost for the customer although it is not paid to the supplier (not in the product / service price). Transaction costs are minimal for commodities. They can rapidly grow for very specific products/projects that require technical and contractual specifications.\n  Depreciation expenses should not be considered as only cash flows are relevant to compute a business case. However, as depreciations have an effect on after-tax cash flows, depreciation impact on taxes may be considered if relevant. Likewise, the additional taxes the firm would have to pay as a result of the project and/or tax reductions that may be granted should be considered.\nFinancing costs are cash flows to the investors and not cash flow from the project. The cost of capital (which is used to discount future cash flows) already account for the cost of financing the project.\n Therefore financing costs (e.g. interest payment) should not be considered in the cash flow stream of the project.\nCash Profile The break even period correspond to the lead-time to balance the cumulated costs with the cumulated revenues. The maximum exposure is the minimum value of the cumulated net cash (this is the amount that needs to be invested before the firm can balance revenues and costs and generate some positive cashflow).\n  It is noteworthy that making profit and generating cash are two distinct concepts.\n A business can make profit even if it still requires and burns cash. Conversely a business can generate cash but make losses from an accounting standpoint (e.g. due to depreciation and amortization).\nSensitivity Analysis\nIt is often useful to simulate the impact that variations on the main parameters would have on the cash profile (exposure, break even, total cash after 10 years, etc).\n  When the cash profile depends on several parameters e.g. \\( f(t, x1, x2, x3) \\), these parameters should usually not be used directly for the sensitivity analysis. It is often more appropriated to define a few scenarios (e.g. S1, S2, S3, S4) and then determine what would be the values of the parameters under each scenario e.g. \\( (x_1^1, x^1_2, x^1_3), (x^2_1, x^2_2, x^2_3), \u0026hellip;, (x^4_1, x^4_2, x^4_3) \\).\nA cash flow profile can then be computed for each scenario.\nDiscounted Business Case Time Value for Money\nOne euro today is not worth one euro tomorrow as today\u0026rsquo;s euro can be invested (in a risk free security) and yield some interest payment. Discounting is therefore the symmetrical operation to capitalizing. The same principal can be applied over a longer period of time and the \u0026lsquo;present value\u0026rsquo; of a value V in i years is : \\( PV = \\frac{V}{(1+d)^i} \\) where d is the discount rate.\n  In theory, the discount rate d varies with time: the discount rate from year \\( n \\) to \\( n + 1 \\) might not be the same than the discount rate \\( n + 1 \\) to \\( n + 2 \\). Practically however, business cases are discounted with constant discount rate.\nOrthodox finance claims that WACC + hurdle should be used as discount rate, where WACC is the weighted average cost of capital and hurdle represents the specific risks associated to the project.\nComparing projects\nMethods such as NPV, IRR and payback period are used to compare candidate projects and select the most promising. NPV is considered the most robust method.\n  A project that yields a positive NPV is creating value. The bigger the NPV, the bigger the value.\n The project profitability index is the ratio of the NPV to the initial cash outlay. In the selection process, the firm should select projects with the highest productivity index until it has allocated the total amount of funds.\nReturn on Investment Return on Investment (ROI) is a broad term that encompasses many different ways of measuring the performance of an investment. In general the absolute values of indicators are not meaningful per se. Instead, indicators are used to compare the performance of a firm to other firms from the same industry or across industries. Indicators can also be used to assess performance evolution over time.\n  A \u0026lsquo;Return\u0026rsquo; on \u0026lsquo;Investment\u0026rsquo; ratio is always some sort of fraction where the numerator measures the performance of a firm and the denominator measures a level of investment.\n  This sections briefly looks at some classical indicators. To do so, it first addresses management accounting, a way to present the accounts of a company that is meaningful for management and corporate finance.\nAccounting Balance Sheet The balance sheet identifies at a specific date the company\u0026rsquo;s assets and the claims to those assets by creditors and owners.\n  On its left side, a balance sheet lists the company\u0026rsquo;s assets (i.e. the uses of the funds, what the company owns: equipment, cash, inventories, money due from customers). On the right side, the balance sheet lists the claims to those assets by the owners and creditors (i.e. the sources of funds, what the company owe to its shareholders, debt holders and suppliers).\n Equity and Liabilities \nEquity represents the contribution by owners to a business, along with any profits that are kept in the business. The contribution provides resources to the company and represents a claim by the owner to profits earned by the business. Debts (financial or operational) correspond to money that was invested in the business while not owned by the business\u0026rsquo;s owners\nIt consists in:\n Capital (at book value) existing share times nominal value.\n Premiums when issuing additional capital, investors will have to pay a premium to be allowed to join the business. The actual price of such shares is premium + nominal value.\n Retain earnings the accumulated profits that have been re-invested in the business, yearly incremented (or decremented) by the net profit minus the dividends paid to shareholders\n Financial debt Borrowing is another source of money for a company, let at the company\u0026rsquo;s disposal by financial actors - for a limited period of time - to help the corporation finance its operations. Creditors (lenders) have a claim for repayment of amounts the company borrowed (the principal of the loan) and for interests on amounts borrowed. Two types of debts are considered, according to their maturity: Long-term debt (supposed to be repaid in more than one year) and Short-term debt (will be repaid within next year which creates a liquidity risk and pressure on cash position). Short Term debts include notes payable, bank overdrafts, lines of credit. The portion of any long term debt due within a year is also considered a short term obligation.\n Operating current liabilities by contrast; corresponds to liabilities generated by the business operations and covering several items: Taxes \u0026amp; social security expenses (that the company must pay but hasn\u0026rsquo;t paid yet), Accounts payable, Dividend payable, Accrued expenses.\n Account Payable are liabilities to the suppliers of the company. it arises because the company doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay immediately the products and services it uses. There is a time lag between the receipt of goods and payment for them.\n Accrued Expenses are liabilities associated to the company\u0026rsquo;s operations (other than short debt debt and account payable). It includes for instance, wage and taxes that are due but have not been paid on the date of the balance sheet.\n    Assets \nBroadly speaking, there are three categories of assets : Tangibles (physical assets), Intangibles (software, patents, trademarks, goodwill) and Financial (e.g. equity invested in non-integrated subsidiaries). Tangible assets are deprecated and Intangible assets are amortized over time.\n Fixed assets equipment (machine, pieces of software, technology) purchased to allow the organization to reach its strategic goals and not renewed at the rate of the operating cycle. As some of the long-term assets are âconsumedâ by the operating cycle, they depreciate and therefore the net asset value correspond to the initial value minus the cumulated depreciation and/or amortization over the years.\n Operating Current Assets are those short-term as- sets used to support the operations of a business. In most organizations, the key operating current assets accounts receivable and all forms of inventory (work in progress at various stages).\n Account Receivable record the invoices that have not been paid yet by customers at the date of the balance sheet. Accounts Receivable are debts ow- ned to the company by its customers. When customers pay their bills, this asset will be converted into cash.\n Pre-paid Expenses correspond to payments already made by the company although the corresponding products or services will be received after (or extend beyond) the date of the balance sheet. For instance, the payment of an insurance policy is usually due in advance and therefore is recorded as pre-paid expenses.\n Inventory are goods (raw materials, finished and semi-finished products) held by the company for future delivery. A manufacturing company has normally three inventory lines in its balanced sheet : raw material, work in progress and finished good.\n Cash \u0026amp; Cash Equivalent encompasses cash in hand, deposit with banks and short-term investments (marketable securities) with maturity not exceeding on year. Sometimes, Cash is subtracted from financial debts which gives the net financial debts.\n  Management Balance sheet The so-called Management Balance Sheet is obtained from the Accounting Balance sheet through moving items (mostly operating debts) from left to right or vice versa (by subtracting the same amount on both side).\n  The two sides of the management balance sheet still sum-up to the same amount.\n  The big interest of the management balance sheet is that it delineate blocks on which specific and distinct management actions can be carried out.\nWays to finance the business For any business there are four main sources of financing:\n   Equity financing can be brought by shareholders either when the firm is incorporated or later during its development.\n Debt firms can borrow money from banks or if its size is sufficient directly from the market (e.g. through bond emission).\n Profit If a firm makes profit, it can retain its earnings and self fund its development\n WCR Reduction decreasing WCR reduces the need for further financing. In addition, if WCR becomes negative (e.g. Account Payable \u0026gt; Ac- count Receivable) then it becomes a true source of financing (e.g. supplier are lending money for free).\n  Reducing the Working Capital Requirement \n  Supplier credit contribute to finance the business (and is free of charge).\nReturn On Sales ROS (Return On Sales) measures the net earnings as a proportion of the revenue. In other words it assesses how much the firm capture value. \\[ ROS = \\frac{EAT}{Sales} \\]\nWhile this is not per se a \u0026lsquo;return on investment\u0026rsquo;, the ROS measures how efficiently a business can turn sales into profit.\n The definition may however vary and the ROS can be a synonym for either the net profit margin (EAT over Sales) or the profit margin (EBIT over Sales).\n  It is prudent to always clarify the definition (e.g. by stating EBIT over Revenue) and make sure that the definition is used consistently. It is therefore highly recommended to always recompute indicators rather than using pre-computed indicators from different sources (e.g. web sites) and running the risk that different formulas were used.\nReturn on Assets and Return on Equity The ROA (Return On Assets) evaluates how effectively assets (the size of the accounting balance sheet) are used. This ratio (as many others) was designed at du Pont de Nemours \u0026amp; company , in the 20\u0026rsquo;s.\nThe ROE (Return On Equity) assesses the performance of a firm (and of its management) relatively to the investment made by shareholders.\n   DuPont Formulas\nThe DuPont formulas break down performance indicators into three elements (themselves indicators). This analysis enables to understand the source of superior return by comparison with companies in similar industries (or between industries). It also guides the establishment of an action plan when performance is insufficient.\nThe ROA can be written \\( ROA = \\frac{EAT}{ASSETS} = \\frac{EAT}{SALES} \\times \\frac{SALES}{ASSETS} = ROS \\times \\frac{SALES}{ASSETS} \\)\nLikewise the ROE can be writte \\( ROE = \\frac{EAT}{EQUITY} = ROS \\times \\frac{SALES}{ASSETS} \\times \\frac{ASSETS}{EQUITY} \\)\nWhere :\n Profit margin (ROS) \\( \\frac{EAT}{Sales} \\) denotes how much the firm captures value in proportion of its turnover.\n Asset turnover (or throughput) \\( \\frac{Sales}{Assets}\\) measures how efficiently assets are used - how much assets are necessary to generate the revenues\n Financial Leverage \\( \\frac{Assets}{Equity}\\) indicates how debt financing is used relative to equity financing - how\n  There are therefore fundamentally three ways to improve the ROA:\n Higher profit margin Increase the ROS (e.g. raise prices or reduce operating costs) while keeping throughput constant (same volume of sale),\n Increase productivity of the assets Improve throughput and grow the sales while keeping profit margin unchanged, for the same level of assets.\n Reduce assets to yield the same level of sales with the same profit margin (e.g. sell \u0026amp; lease back some fixed assets, reduce WCR)\n    Comparing Companies\nComparing each factor with companies in similar industry (or across industries) helps improving the ROE. By and large there are three major types of industries:\n High margin industries derive their earnings from selling at high price with high margin. ROS is the dominant factor in ROE. Increasing sales while not destroying margin can be challenging (e.g. haute couture fashion, luxury industry)\n High turn over industries certain sectors yield very little margins (e.g.retailing, low-cost businesses, \u0026hellip;) but have very high turnover and can sell a significant multiple of their assets per year.\n High leverage industries some industries can rely on very high leverage (e.g. financial sector) while offering rather small profit margin or asset turnover.\n  ROCE While ROE and ROA are computed from the Accounting Balance Sheet, ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) is derived from the Management Balance Sheet.\nThe objective of the ROCE is to focus on the economic value created (or destroyed) independently of the accurate structure of the income statement and balance sheet.\n   NOPAT\nNon-operating and financial activities (non-recurring gain or losses) can significantly influence the net income of a firm on a given year. Likewise, interest expense depends on the financial leverage (how much debt) and do not reflect the performance of operations.\nNOPAT is a way to approximate what a firm earns from its operations. NOPAT approximates earnings before interest after taxes (EBIAT).\n \\[ EBT = EBIT - I \\] \\[ EAT = EBT.(1 - T_r) = (EBIT - I) (1 - T_r) \\] \\[ EAT = EBIT.(1-T_r) - I.(1-T_r)\\] \\[ NOPAT = EIBT.(1-T_r) \\]\nIt is noteworthy that very often the ROCE is computed from the EBIT instead of the NOPAT. This may be an issue when comparing firms that are not exposed to the same (average) tax rate.\nROCE\nROCE measures the NOPAT relatively to the size of the management balance sheet.\nSometimes, analysts use what they call a pre-tax ROCE which is in fact ROS over CE.\nThe ROCE compares what is earned from operations to how much the business needs to run its operations.\n \\[ ROCE = \\frac{NOPAT}{CE} = \\frac{EBIT}{CE} . (1-T_r) \\]\nOne of the main drawback of ROCE is that Capital Employed represents the book value of assets. As a consequence, the ROCE tends to increase with time as assets depreciate and Capital Employed decreases. Longstanding businesses will therefore have higher ROCE than newer ventures.\nIn addition, earnings are affected by inflation and will mechanically increase with time while Capital Employed will not. Consequently analyzing the evolution of the ROCE of a company over time can be quite challenging.\n ROCE decomposition\n  Economic Value Added Capital Employed represents the amount of financing that a business needs to run its operations. Assuming all the financing comes from either shareholders of debt holders, the cost of financing the business is WACCxCE.\nOn the other hand, Capital Employed allows the business to yield ROCExCE by definition of ROCE.\n  The Economic Value Added is the difference between what the firm earns (ROCExCE) and the (opportunity) costs of running the business (WACCxCE).\nGrowth fallacy\nThe difference ROCE - WACC is name the spread. It needs to be positive for the firm to create value for its shareholders. If the spread is negative, the firm is destroying value.\n  One could be tempted to believe that by increasing the amount invested, earnings would mechanically grow.\nThis is indeed what suggests the linearity of the Economic Value Added formula. However, by increasing the business, the WACC may change (e.g. if the overall risk increases) and the ROCE is likely to evolve as well.\nHow Much is Worth a Firm There are several popular valuation methods to assess the value of a project (including the acquisition of a company).\n Valuation by comparable looks for similar firms, or firms specialized (focussed peers / proxy) into the same business and infer a price by comparison (usually as a multiple of EBITDA).\n Discounted cash-flow (DCF) present value of the stream of cash flows.\n Liquidation value amount of cash that the firm would receive if it would sell separately its various assets (trade receivable, inventories, equipment, land, buildings, etc). It is the minimum price you would have to pay for the firmâs assets\n Replacement value what it would cost today to replace the various firmâs assets. This is the maximum price you would accept to pay for the tangible assets. However, you may accept to pay more for some intangible assets controlled by the firm.\n  Free Cash Flow The Free Cash Flow is a flow (i.e. computed over a period of time) that corresponds to the cash that the firm can allocate to the Capital owners (Equity or Debt holders).\nThe net cash position is a stock. The difference between the net cash position at two dates, is the free cash flow over the corresponding period.\nComputing the Free Cash Flow of a project\nThere are several ways to compute the Free Cash Flow associated with a project.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with assessing the effect of depreciation on taxes:\n\\[ EAT = EBIT - I - EBIT.T_r \\] \\[EBIT.T_r = (EBITDA - DA).T_r = EBITDA.T_r - DA.T_r \\]\nThus, if a project requires some \u0026ldquo;capex\u0026rdquo;, it will later produce a flow of Depreciation \u0026amp; Amortisation (DA), which will reduce the total taxes in proportion.\nThe net cash inflows of a project consist therefore in:\n Operations: \\( EBITDA \\times (1 - T_r) \\)\n Impacts on taxes: \\( DA \\times T_r \\)\n  The cash outflows are:\n Incremental Capex (yearly): \\( \\Delta Capex \\)\n Incremental WRC (yearly) Working Capital Requirement: \\( \\Delta WCR \\)\n   Discounted Cash Flow \nOne of the most important decisions a manager can make is the capital investment decision: spending cash now to acquire long-lived assets that will generate cash flows in the future. Capital budgeting involves comparing the amount of cash spent today on an investment with the cash inflows in the future. As future cash inflows are spread over time, they must be converted into their equivalent today value.\nCapital budgeting involves comparing the amount of cash spent today on an investment with the cash inflows in the future. As future cash inflows are spread over time, they must be converted into their equivalent today value. The present value is the discounted value of future cash flows (possibly including some risks associated with future payments).\nTypical capital investment process: identify opportunities, estimate future cash flows and discount rate, assess the impact of tax treatment, select \u0026amp; implement.\nValuation through DCF The (present) value of any company yields from the series of its future Free Cash Flows. Assuming that the future cash flows can be assessed, it becomes easy to assess the value of a company.\n  Infinite annuity Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose that the cash flows increase over time at a constant rate g. On the first year, it is \\( C \\), on the second it is \\( C(1+g) \\) and on the nth ii is \\( C(1+G)^{n}\\).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s also assume that the discount rate d is constant. How much is the present value of this infinite series of annuities ?\n  DCF Value\nThe total DFC is the sum of the present value of the n first years plus the present value of the terminal value (computed on year n).\n  Enterprise Value The enterprise value is an attempt to measure how much a business is worth. EV approximates a (theoretical) take over price. Actual transactions are usually not made at EV price, still it is common practice to provide EV for listed companies.\n  In theory, taking-over 100% of a company would require buying all the shares (at market value). With all the shares in hand, one would own the cash and the so called enterprise value, but would still have to repay the debts of the company\nSo Market Capitalization = EV + Cash - Debt.\nIn other words EV = MarketCap + Debt - Cash.\n"

	"content": "Strategy is about making choice, about allocating resource to the best projects or strategic options.\nA firm usually faces several options : for instance developing new products or entering a new business (diversification). Not all the options can be pursued at the same time (remember scarcity of resources). The firm needs to prioritize the various options and down-select the few it wants to implement.\n  Even a single strategy elaboration project can produce more than one proposal. It is not uncommon that several strategic profiles are generated out of the formulation phase. It is then necessary to rank the various profiles and point out a rationale for recommending one option/profile rather than the others. Many criteria and attributes can be taken into account to compare the various strategic options. One obvious criterion is the total amount of resources (financial, human, lead-time) that the firm is ready or capable to engage into the strategic move. Risk level is also a major aspect to consider (some firms are more risk avert than others). These two criteria define a kind of envelope within which several options can be ranked\nSelection is usually a twofold process: first, the options that wouldn’t work or could be achieved are eliminated. Then the remaining options are ranked according to some objective function.\n  The options that are eliminated can correspond to many different situations. It can for instance, be a scenario that proved not to be technically feasible. It can be a strategic move that would be prevented by too many and/or too high barriers. It may also be a project for which the inherent risk is not compensated by a sufficient return on investment. Last but not least, it may be a proposal that would be too remote from the firm’s culture or wouldn’t meet its corporate social responsibility values.\nCriteria are used to down select the options that can work and reject the others. Down selection can start very early during the analysis \u0026amp; formulation phase (especially to reject options). It is always a good practice to explicit all the criteria used to rank the various options. Even if evaluating an option against such criteria can be to some extend subjective, it is better to try to make explicit appraisals.\nThe down-selection occurs at the end of the formulation phase (at least to check that the proposals meet the objectives while complying with the constraints). However, option elimination usually starts very early. It is therefore very important to record the reasons for which an idea / option is kept or rejected. Indeed, criteria can evolve during the analysis and it might be necessary to revisit some ranking/selection/rejection.\n  "

According to them, ”Vision” provides guidance about what core to preserve and what future to stimulate progress toward.\nThe Vision Framework They also underline that ”Vision” has become one of the most overused and least understood concept. To overcome this shortfall, they suggest that ”Vision” must be approach from two distinct notions: the Core Ideology and the Envisioned future.\n   The Core Ideology defines a company’s timeless character, its DNA. It is barely impacted by external influences. It represents what the company stands for, its reason for being. It is a consistent identity that transcends current product portfolio and market presence. It is often inherited from the founders of the company. „The core values and purpose, if properly conceived, remain fixed. Everything else – practices, strategies, structures, systems, policies, and procedure – should be open for change. Truly great companies understand what is genuinely sacred, what should never change and what should be open to change.” (Collins) Some company have formal core ideology statement, while other despite having a very strong and authentic Core ideology have not formally articulated it.\n The Envisioned Future corresponds to what the company aspires to become. to achieve, to create. Reaching the envisioned future usually involves significant changes and progress will span over several years or decades.\n  Core Ideology Core Value Core Value corresponds to the few (typically three to five) principles by which a company navigates. These principles don’t require external justification and are not an attempt to match specific characteristics of the ecosystem\nThere is no idea of moral sense associated with the concept of Core Value. An organization should identify what it really is. A terrorist organization will as well have (usually very strong) core value.\n  According to Collins it can be difficult to identify core value: „ you cannot ”set” organizational values, you can only discover them.” ([Collins and Porras, 1996])\n„A great company decides for itself what values it holds to be core, largely independently from the current environment, competitive requirements or management fads” ([Collins and Porras, 1996]). For instance, Collins stresses that a company don’t necessarily need to have among its Core Values:\n ’customer service’ [Sony doesn’t],\n \u0026lsquo;respect for the individuals\u0026rsquo; [Disney doesn’t],\n \u0026lsquo;quality\u0026rsquo; [Wal-Mart doesn’t],\n \u0026lsquo;market focus\u0026rsquo; [HP doesn’t]\n \u0026lsquo;teamwork\u0026rsquo; [Nodstrom doesn’t]\n  One of the rule of thumb suggested by Collins is that a company would rather stop its current business and seek out different customers in order to remain true to its core value.\n In fact we can often intuitively determine wether of not a business or practice fits with a company’s core values.\n  Core Purpose The Core Purpose is „the most fundamental reason for being. It reflects people’s idealistic motivation for doing the company working.” (Collins and Porras)\nFor instance, Collins stresses that David Packard, one of the founders of HP was used to declare: „Why are we here? I think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money. While this is an important result of a company’s existence, we have to go deeper and find the real reason for our being.” (Packard)\n  More often than not, a core purpose has impact on the lives of the company’s customers and whomever they are trying to serve. However, a core purpose should not be confused with a business goal (not even with bold hairy audacious goals). Indeed unlike goals, purpose can never be completely fulfilled. The core Purpose should remain constant during at least a century „like a north star on the horizon that is forever pursued but never reached.” (Collins and Porras)\nThe following examples illustrate Core Purposes:\n 3M innovate to solve unsolved problems\n ING Empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business\n IAG Insurance To help people manage risks and recover from hardship of unexpected loss.\n Fannie Mae To strengthen the social fabric by continually democratizing home ownership\n McKinsey\u0026amp;Company to help leading corporations and governments be more successful\n  The Five whys method (asking five times Why ) can help getting down the fundamental : start with a description of the current products/services (we deliver service xxx) and ask why it is important. For instance, Collins provides the following example :\n [first iteration] We provide the best market-research data available\n [second iteration] We provide the best market-research data so that our customers will understand their markets better than they could otherwise\n [core purpose] We contribute to our customers’ success by helping them understand their markets\n  The Golden Circle „There are a few leaders who choose to inspire rather than manipulate in order to motivate people. Whether individuals or organisations, every single one of these inspiring leaders, thinks, acts and communicates exactly the same way. And it is the complete opposite of the rest of us” (S. Sinek).\n  „Most people and organization think, act and communicate from the outside in, from the clearest things to the fuzziest – for them” (S. Sinek). By contrast „inspiring leaders think, act and communicate from the inside out” (S. Sinek).\nS. Sinek describes the two communication patterns through what he calls the Golden Circle: three concentric circles.\n What represents the products and services a company sells or the activities an individual performs. What is usually easy to identify.\n How some companies and people know How they do What they do. They would usually call it their distinctive technology or differentiating process.\n Why by contrast, very few people or companies can clearly articulate why they do what they do : what is their purpose, their cause and their belief. Why does the company exists, why should their employees get out of bed every morning and why should anybody care\n  A classical sale pitch starts from the product and explains why it is better (i.e. how different it is). ACME Computers, for instance, would explain that they make great computers (what) and that they are beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly (how).\nAccording to Sinek, Apple’s approach is different. They start by their Why : Everything we do, we believe in challenging the stats quo. We believe in thinking differently. then they explain How they challenge the status quo, for instance by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. They happen to make great computers (their what). However, unlike with ACME, their products are not the starting point but the materialization of their Why. The products and services they offer, represent a tangible evidence of their purpose : why they are in business.\n„People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you are doing it” (S. Sinek)\n Everything Apple does, contributes to demonstrating their Why. We perceive Apple as being very authentic. Apple’s WHY (challenge the status quo) has for- med in the early 70’s and hasn’t changed since then. For instance, they have redirected the course of the personal computer industry (Apple II, MacIntosh, MacBook Air). They have reinvented the music industry with the introduction of iTune. They created the momentum for tablets with the iPad. Most other companies in personal computers or small electronics focus on ’what’ and have been commoditized (e.g. IBM or COMPAQ once leaders in personal computers, have left the segment).\nCurrent portfolio vs Core Purpose The current practices and product portfolio must not be confused with the Core purpose. McKinsey aims at help leading corporations and governments be more successful and offer management consulting. They may decide one day to complement their portfolio of services or even stop management consulting while keeping their core purpose.\nIn 1996, 3M realised that some of their very mature business (data storage) were lucrative but loosely aligned with their Core Purpose. As a result they divested these businesses and re-invested into activities that were better aligned with their Purpose.\nStatements \u0026hellip; that \u0026lsquo;suck\u0026rsquo; Many statements are bare platitudes or mere assemblies of buzz words. Some become incongruous or even totally meaningless. It reached such a level that famous newspapers (not famous for their sense of humor though) published articled on how to avoid mission statements that ’suck’.\nThe Wall Street Journal (June 2009) made an experiment. They asked various consultancies and business schools to produce a mission statement for a hypothetical food business. The initial statement we serve the tastiest damn pizza in Wake County (which gives a clear and appealing description of the company purpose) went through various transformations and resulted a completely meaningless statement.\nThe Financial Times also analyzed (May 2010) a sample of strategy statements among the worst it could find. \u0026ldquo;Undisputed Marketplace Leadership\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;top-tier value creation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;portfolio of brands\u0026rdquo; seems to be the top-3 most frequent buzzwords (mis-)used by statement writers. A lot of imagination can be required to discover in which business some companies operate, from reading their mission statement.\n  Envisaged future BEE HAGS A big hairy audacious goals (read Bee - HAG) is a clearly articulated ambition plan that mobilize the full organization. It typically require several decades to materialize a B-HAG.\nB-HAG can be quantitative (e.g. become a $125 billion company by the year 2000 Wall-mart – 1990) or qualitative (e.g. land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth).\n  A BHAG is a visionary target that is more strategic and emotionally compelling compared to usual businesses goals. In Collins words „there is a difference between merely having goal and becoming committed to a huge, daunting and energizing challenge.” ([Collins and Porras, 1996])\nUsual business goals describe what a company seek to accomplish over the coming days, months or years. Most goals are very tactical. By contrast „ a BHAG is an audacious 10-to-30-year goal to progress towards an envisioned future. It serves as unifying focal point of effort, and acts as a clear catalyst for team spirit. It has a clear finish line, so the organization can know when it has achieved the goal ; people like to shoot for finish lines.” ([Collins and Porras, 2004])\n  In the 50’s Japan economy wasn’t what it is today and Japan products had a reputation of poor quality and low performance. Sony, a firm created in 1946, set a B-HAG aiming at changing that perception and getting associated to quality and innovation.\n  Vivid description To be inspiring for employees and customers, a BHAG must be translated into a vivid description : a compelling description of what it will be like to achieve the goal. It should be inspiring, tangible and engaging.\nAs Collins put it „Maximizing shareholder wealth doesn’t inspire people at all levels of an organisation and it provides precious little guidance.” (Collins and Porras.)\n  An B-HAG can be articulated in a one-minute elevator ride or put on a single piece of paper. The goal must be very simple (to understand, not necessarily to achieve) and as crisp as possible.\nFor instance Henry Ford claimed „I will build a motor car for the great multitude \u0026hellip; It will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God’s great open spaces \u0026hellip; The horse will have disappeared from our highways” (H. Ford)\nDon’t use jargon, buzzword or techno-geeky stuff. Don’t produce catch phrases or slogans either. In contrast set clear image and include passion, emotion and conviction.\nCompare:\n„Our mission is to become the international leader in space industry through maximum team-centered innovation and strategically targeted initiatives\u0026rdquo; (Aerospace company)\nwith\n„Put a man on the moon and return him safely, by the end of the decade” (JFK) (a single idea that has motivated millions of people for a decade\nStrategy is about being different In her recent seminal book ([Montgomery, 2012]) Cynthia Montgomery suggests that Purpose is the cornerstone of strategy and articulating a clear \u0026amp; motivating purpose for the organization is one of the key outcomes for a strategist.\n  „A CEO must be the steward of a living strategy that defines what the firm is and what it will become” (C. Montgomery)\n„Nothing else is more important to the survival and success of a firm than why it exists and what otherwise unmet needs it intends to fill. A good purpose is a commitment – choosing to be one thing and not being something else.\nA purpose sets you apart and makes you distinct : the specific reason for which you exist, the specific customers you want to serve, the market needs you want to fill. ” (C. Montgomery)\nA good purpose also sets the stage for value creation and capture. Your purpose must give you a difference that matters in your industry.\nIf your firm disappeared today, would the world be different tomorrow ? In Montgomery’s own words: “When you ask managers to describe their com- panies, most tell you what industry they are in, may be what geographies. If you press them more they might tell you something about their market share, maybe even their profitability. But if you ask them – why does your company matters ? – and I’m not asking here about a firm’s social purpose but also about its economic purpose – they pause. They are not used to thinking about their companies this way. You must be able to describe what your company brings to the world and what would be lost if it weren’t here, why the world needs the business and why it will support it, why enough customers will be willing to pay sufficiently high prices to buy its good and services”.\n  For short, a purpose outlines what is the organization there to do that makes a difference, on to whom. A well expressed purpose should be easy to grasp. It provides clarity of mind/guidance for employees, investors, customers and suppliers. People can easily relate to it.\n"

In other words, the firm will work toward putting the strategic recommendations into effect. More often than not, this includes launching specific projects (aka strategic initiatives) possibly acquiring other companies and creating new products/services to conquer new markets.\nHowever, strategy elaboration is also a project in its own right it is a temporary endeavor (possibly managed by an ad-hoc organization), having a defined beginning and end (usually characterized by dates), undertaken to meet a specific, non-repetitive goal (produce well educated strategic recommendations).\nMost project management techniques also apply to strategy elaboration with some specificities though.\n "

	"content": " Give me six hours to chop down a tree I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.  ABRAHAM LINCOLN  There is an endless list of techniques, frameworks and tricks that have their use in strategy elaboration. Almost each and every new book or article on strategy, put forward a new set of analytical tools, diagnosis canvas or action frameworks.\nThe objective of this part is to see a glimpse of some of the most common or most used tools. The aim is not to comprehensively review themselves tools, but to get a feeling about i) how they can be used in practice, ii) what are their benefits and also iii) what are their most common pitfalls.\nThe SWOT analysis is one of the best-known tools, supposedly easy to use, and it is therefore very popular. People will often expect to see a SWOT and it is advisable to be ready to prepare and deliver one. This famous analysis (derived from the LCAG model) aims at assessing both internal \u0026amp; external factors and identifying the actions needed if the organization is either to capitalize upon opportunities or minimize the impact of the threats.\n"

	"content": " Even when it is explicitly formulated, a strategy does include detailed actions for all stakeholders. On the contrary, it should focus on top level considerations and ensure alignment, while leaving a lot of freeway to the people in charge of executing.\n  Organization alignment D. Sull \u0026amp; K.M. Eisenhardt (\u0026nbsp; [Sull15] \u0026nbsp;) have rightly pointed out that if an organization’s strategy lives on the shelf then this organization has a problem. How to bridge the gap between strategy and execution? According to them, by polishing simple statements that help making on-the-spot decisions and adapting to rapidly changing circumstances\nIndeed, they argue that while a checklist or any other process adherence technique is usually well adapted in repetitive situation (e.g. safety control) to ensure the activities alignment with corporate objectives. Agreeing on a simple ’principle’ is more adequate in more dynamic environment however, where flexibility is important. Process operators can then decide the most appropriate action to cope with the principle, subject to the actual circumstances.\nIn A.C. Hax’s words the true purpose [of the strategy statement] is to capture and clearly articulate our intent. Strategy is a fundamental vehicle to communicate our sense of direction, both inside and outside the organization. It aims to give purpose and direction to an organization and end up with the proper implementation of a well-designed strategy.\nThis simple idea of not trying to fix in advance every tiny detail was made famous by D. Eisenhower who claimed No plan survive the first contact with the enemy.\n  Chip \u0026amp; Dan Heath (\u0026nbsp; [Heath07] \u0026nbsp;) hammer on the message. The planning process forces people to think through the right issues, however even if you may start off trying to fight your plan, the enemy gets a vote.\nIn the 80’s the Army invented the concept of CI (Commander’s intend): a crisp, plain-talk statement, specifying the goal, the desired end-state. You can lose the ability to execute the original plan but you never lose the responsibility of executing the CI.\nThe commander’s intend should phrase something like if we do nothing else, we must : xxx or something like the single most important thing is: xx.\nCompelling stories \u0026amp; Catch phrases The hard part in producing such a statement is weeding out ideas that are important but not the most important. Finding the core is about discarding a lot of insights to let shine the most important insight. Consistently repeating a simple statement (or intent) is the best way to ensure that all the stakeholders in the organization receive the message and then make appropriate decisions.\nChip \u0026amp; Dan Heath quote this story from Herb Kelleher, the CEO of SouthWest : *„Tracy from marketing comes into my office and she says that surveys show that the passengers might enjoy a Cesar salad on the Houston to Las Vegas flight. What do you answer? You respond: Tracy, will adding that chicken salad make us THE low-cost airline from Houston to Vegas? Because if it doesn’t help us become the unchallenged low-cost airline, then we’re not serving any damn chicken salad.*” (Southwest’s CEO)\nNo one knows if there ever existed a Tracy in Southwest Marketing, but the story drives the point home: Southwest is THE low-cost company. Southwest has been very consistent in its intent over the years and has also been one of the only consistently profitable airline for more than 30 years.\n  Telling stories is also a way to make sure the staff can remember and feel the purpose of a strategic move. According to J. Conger (\u0026nbsp; [Conger08] \u0026nbsp;) Herb Kelleher used to tell the following story when visiting his operations across the United States: „It’s funny, I get letters all the time from shareholders and they’re often angry letters. They say : ’American West is flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for $149 one way. And you, Herb Kelleher at Southwest, are pricing $79 for that same one-way ticket. Don’t you have the decency to at least kick your price up to $129 ? Why are you leaving so much on the table ?’ Well, what I do is write and reply : Thank you so much for your letter. However you don’t understand who we are, and you really don’t understand who our competition is. It’s automobile; it’s not other airlines. And $79 is the price to drive, including maintenance, insurance and gasoline, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. That’s how we price or ticket. ” (Southwest’s CEO)\n"

	"content": " It became rather standard for companies (at least listed companies) to write Strategy statements with the twofold objective of i) stressing the fundamental goals that the organization seeks (including delineating the scope and domain of their activities, outlining the particular advantages or capabilities they hold) and ii) communicating the underlying and enduring core principles that guide the way the organization should operate.\n  Although there is no unanimous agreement on what a vision / mission statement should be, common wisdom sees a firm’s mission as a long-term ambition, preferably enthusiastically phrased, that ensures the identity, consistency and stability of the firm.\n„Strategic management is characterised by the capacity to lead men towards the realization of a design. There can be no strategy without a will, vision or intent” ([Grandval and Ronteau, 2011]).\nThe vision should explicit the reasons why people would support and value the firm, why investors and lenders would provide funds, why customers would want to buy form it and why the appropriate people would be ready to work (hard) for it.\nVision The vision aims to provoke the construction of an invented future. It articulate (usually in bold and compelling terms) what the company wants to achieve. The vision statement is usually one-sentence statement describing the clear and inspirational long-term desired change resulting from an organization or program’s work.\nVision statements are used equally by profit and non-profit organizations, e.g. :\n „A computer on every desk in every home” (Microsoft in the 90’s),\n „Shaping the future by preserving our heritage, discovering new knowledge and sharing resources with the world” (Smithsonian),\n „to provide access to the world’s information in one click” (Google)\n „Prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors” (Red Cross\n  The vision is an intellectual representation of what the company aim to become in the future. The vision sets a horizon (\u0026nbsp; [Beenis85] \u0026nbsp;) while leaving much room for innovation. A vision must be:\n Realist the vision aims to transform the organization and get it to exceed its own limits, but it must remain consistent with the surrounding environment and its likely evolution,\n Credible the vision federates the energies of individuals and encourages them to stretch their own comfort zone. It must not, however, become excessive and disproportionate compared to the existing resources of the firm, otherwise its mobilizing effect may get lost,\n Compelling the vision must be original, attractive and constitute a promise, a dream. The vision must suggest how the company intends to distinguish itself from its competitors.\n  „ A VISION is the future desired state and goals that represent an aspiration which helps mobilize the energy and passion of organization members. The vision answers the question: “what do we want to achieve?” – [Johnson et al., 2011]\n The vision statement should focus on the end result (if i about the “*what*” and not about the “*how*”). Henry Ford for instance had the vision that “*the ownership of a car should be within the reach of every man*’ ’. Amazon’s vision is “*to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online*’.\nThe vision statement may suggest what competitive advantage the company can derive in the years to come; i.e. how the company will build a set of distinctive resources \u0026amp; competences that will match the evolution of its environment and allow to out-perform competition.\nThe vision is a declaration of principle and needs to be supplemented by more specific elements. Note: sometimes vision and mission statements are permuted, that is the mission statement is the broadest and the vision statement the more specific.\nMission The mission characterizes and clarifies the vocation, the purpose of the company to its customers and stakeholders. „*The mission (or purpose) is the first dimension that is more operational. It characterizes and clarifies the vocation, the raison d’être of the company for its customers and more broadly its stakeholders. It positions the company on the market and in contrast to its competitors. It stresses the businesses, main activities, key differentiating factors and strategic objectives of the company. It defines the framework within which, from day to day, decisions are made. It extends the values of the company, its culture” (johnson2011)\n„ A MISSION is the the overriding purpose of the organization. The mission answers the question: “ what business are we in ? ” – [Johnson et al., 2011]. A mission statement is a kind of umbrella value proposition.” – [Johnson et al., 2011] „ A MISSION is the the overriding purpose of the organization. The mission answers the question: “ what business are we in ? ” – [Johnson et al., 2011]. A mission statement is a kind of umbrella value proposition.” – [Johnson et al., 2011]\n By and large, the mission describes what the company does ([Hill et al., 2016]). For instance the BBC claims that „Our vision is to be the most creative organization in the world” (www.bbc.uk) which suggests differentiation based on creation. Their mission statement is more precise and can be assimilated to a value proposition : „Our purpose is to enrich people’s lives with programms and services that inform, educate and entertain. ” (ibidem).\n"

	"content": " Practitioner\u0026rsquo;s Perspective on Strategy This site is used as training material for Master\u0026rsquo;s level courses that I teach at the Graduate School of Management  from Toulouse University.\nThe course was created in 2009 and initially was dedicated to very practical aspects. However I quickly observed that most students (as well as many managers):\n often struggle with many underlying concepts, while usually being familiar with strategic management jargon;\n often prefer qualitative approaches and have more difficulties with quantitative aspects;\n are looking for \u0026lsquo;ready-to-use\u0026rsquo; recipes and expect some sort of \u0026lsquo;automated process\u0026rsquo;.\n  In 2013, I released an expanded version, known by several cohorts of students as \u0026ldquo;the booklet\u0026rdquo;, that included definitions for the key notions (even those that are deemed known), provided some insight about business economics and corporate finance, and last but not least, introduced the fundamentals of corporate development.\nOver the years, more and more contents have be added (while I also stopped to use some others). The booklet became a website in 2018. If I may paraphrase P. Drucker (\u0026nbsp; [Druker85] \u0026nbsp;) this site seeks to equip the reader with (some of) \u0026ldquo;the understanding, the thinking, the knowledge and the skills for strategy formulation\u0026rdquo;.\nPlease note that, this site is neither a textbook nor is intended to replace one. Students interested in the field of strategic management and/or are planning to pursue a career in strategy/consulting are invited to consider these lines as a starting point for a broader journey. The bibliography  contains some very good entry points for further reading.\nPlease note as well that the views expressed herein are those of the author.

The difference is called acquisition premium.\nIn addition to paying the former shareholders, the new owner needs to pay transaction costs (to bankers, consultants, etc\u0026hellip;) and post merger integration costs (e.g. alignment of the management information systems, finance reporting, etc\u0026hellip;).\nIt is also very common that during first months after an acquisition the customer base shrinks: some existing customers decide to switch to other suppliers.\nTo compensate for all these cost items, the new owner must create cost synergies (doing the same with less costs) and revenue synergies (e.g. cross-selling and leveraging a larger sale force). Value is created only if the sum of the synergies exceeds the sum of the costs\n"
