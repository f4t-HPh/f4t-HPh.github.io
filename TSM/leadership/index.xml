      <description>VISION
Strategy is what determines the framework of a firm&amp;rsquo;s business activities and provides guidelines for coordinating activities so that the firm can cope with and influence the changing environment. Strategy articulates the firm&amp;rsquo;s preferred environment and the type of organization it is striving to become - Hiroyuki Itami.
Mission &amp;ldquo;the enduring set of fundamental principles (including the core values, believes, functioning habits) outlining what purpose the organisation wishes to serve, in what domain and under which conditions&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>James Collins and Jerry Porras in their pivotal research (&amp;nbsp;
[Collins96]
[Collins04]
&amp;nbsp;) offer a framework to clarify the various ingredients of a vision.
  First, they stress that while a company should adapt its strategy to reflect evolutions and changes in its environment, its vision should remain and sustain over time. According to them, ”Vision” provides guidance about what core to preserve and what future to stimulate progress toward.</description>

      <description>It became rather standard for companies (at least listed companies) to write Strategy statements with the twofold objective of i) stressing the fundamental goals that the organization seeks (including delineating the scope and domain of their activities, outlining the particular advantages or capabilities they hold) and ii) communicating the underlying and enduring core principles that guide the way the organization should operate.
  Although there is no unanimous agreement on what a vision / mission statement should be, common wisdom sees a firm’s mission as a long-term ambition, preferably enthusiastically phrased, that ensures the identity, consistency and stability of the firm.</description>
