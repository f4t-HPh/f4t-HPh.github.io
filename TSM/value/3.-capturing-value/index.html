<h3 id="a-firm-transforms-inputs-into-outputs">A Firm transforms inputs into outputs</h3>

<p>Any firm, whether it produces products or services, <strong>transforms some inputs into outputs</strong>. Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables. Firms acquire the inputs from their suppliers in upstream markets and deliver their products or services to their direct customers in downstream markets.</p>

<p><b>Capital Equipment</b>: the transformation process may also require items (e.g. machinery, intellectual property) that are not transformed in the process and can be used repeatedly.</p>

<p>For B2C (<em>Business to Consumers</em>), customers are the final consumers of the products, whereas B2B (<em>Business to Business</em> firms deliver their products to other firms.</p>

<p>We start with an over-simplified case where there is a single supplier providing the goods, a single firm and a single customer acquiring the product. The actual price at which the product is sold and the <strong>actual price</strong> received by the supplier for the goods result from the <strong>bargaining</strong> between the customer and the firm on the one hand and between the firm and the supplier on the other. However two pivotal concepts, the willingess to pay and the willingness to sell.</p>

<p>fig</p>

<h3 id="how-to-measure-value-for-the-firm">How to measure Value for the firm ?</h3>

<p>Value creation corresponds to the total perceived value net from the total expenses (including direct &amp; indirect costs, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) incurred to design, produce and deliver the product or service.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/F/007.png"/> 
</figure>


<p>Some of this value is transferred to customers (Customer’s surplus) and some (the difference between the transaction price and the total cost of the good) is kept by the firm. Any firm must ensure that it both creates value at least for some customer groups and claims value so that it can generates some profit.</p>


<div class="notices tip" ><p>The  <b style="font-variant:small-caps;"> total created value </b> is (not necessarily equitably) shared between the <b style="font-variant:small-caps;"> delivered value</b> transferred to customers as surplus and the <b style="font-variant:small-caps;"> captured value </b> kept by the firm.</p>
</div>


<p>Most of the time a company has suppliers (i.e. it participates to a value system). Each of the players in a value system does not receive a remuneration only in proportion to the value it creates, but as well in proportion to its market power and the exercise of that power) in the sector.</p>

<h3 id="a-firm-transforms-inputs-into-outputs-1">A Firm transforms inputs into outputs</h3>

<p>Any firm, whether it produces products or services, <strong>transforms some inputs into outputs</strong>. Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables. Firms acquire the inputs from their suppliers in upstream markets and deliver their products or services to their direct customers in downstream markets.</p>

<p>For B2C (<em>Business to Consumers</em>), customers are the final consumers of the products, whereas B2B (<em>Business to Business</em> firms deliver their products to other firms.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:In the remaining of the text, the word <em>product</em> will be used for any firm&rsquo;s output (i.e. for both products and services.)</p>

<h3 id="willingness-to-pay">Willingness to Pay</h3>

<p>The <strong>Willingness-to-Pay</strong> is the maximum price a customer is ready to pay to acquire a given good. It corresponds to what economists name <em>usefulness</em>, <em>economic satisfaction</em> or <em>utility</em>. This is the amount for which the customer is (theoretically) indifferent between keeping her/his money or obtaining the good. At a higher price, the customer would rather keep the money (which is worth more than the good’s utility for that customer). If offered at a price which s strictly inferior to the willingness to pay, then the customer can consider a commercial transaction. The difference between the transaction price and the perceived value is named customer’s surplus. If customers are rational, the surplus must always be positive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In economy, utility doesn’t convey any ethical, moral, religious or political connotation but only reflects preferences from economic agents. V. Pareto proposed to use the word ophelimity instead of utility. Likewise Irving Fisher suggested <em>wantability</em>, however <em>utility</em> was already too well established in economics literature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>fig</p>

<p>Usually <em>Willingness to Pay</em> cannot be easily measured.
Brandburger &amp; Harborne (&nbsp;

    
    
<a href="/biblio/index.html#b">[Brandbuger96b]</a>

&nbsp;)
 suggest the following thought experience to better capture the concept:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if a rational customer is offered a product for free, he should be better off with that product than without it (economists call that the non-satiation axiom).</p></li>

<li><p>from that situation, start to take money away from the customer (i.e. ask him to pay). When the amount of monety taken away is small, the customer should still prefer the situation with the product compared to the situation without the product.</p></li>

<li><p>however as more money is taken away, there should be a moment when the customer prefers to keep his money and give the product back.</p></li>

<li><p>the <em>willingness to pay</em> corresponds to the amount where the customer gauges that the situation with the product (less money) and without the product (with money) are equivalent.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h3>

<p>The situation from the supplier&rsquo;s perspective is symmetrical: the <strong>Willingness-to-sell</strong> (aka <em>willingness-to-accept</em>, <em>reservation price</em>) is the amount for which the supplier is indifferent between selling or not selling. A supplier would accept any price higher than the willingness to sell, but would reject any lower offer.</p>

<p>fig</p>

<p>The willingness-to-pay is also known as the <strong>opportunity cost</strong> of selling, that is the value which is given up when the good is sold. The opportunity cost is the cost  (loss of potential gain)incurred by not enjoying the value (utility) associated with the best alternative to selling the  good.</p>

<p>The employment of resource services in any manner involves a cost to the resource owners. This cost consists in their own evaluation of forgone alternatives, an evaluation made at the moment of commitment.  J. Buchanan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ross Gittins (&nbsp;

    
    
<a href="/biblio/index.html#g">[Gittins]</a>

&nbsp;)
 the Economics Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, stresses that the concept of Opportunity Cost while foundational to microeconomics can be misleading and even economists can get it wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opportunity cost of a decision is the value (utility) of the next-best alternative. Imagine you win a free ticket (that cannot be resold) to see an Eric Clapton. On that same day, there is a Bod Dylan concert priced $40, knowing that you would usually be ready to pay $50 to see Dylan in concert. Going to Dylan&rsquo;s concert is your best alternative to Clapton&rsquo;s concert. What is the opportunity cost of going to Clapton&rsquo;s concert ? $10 as you are forgoing $50 utility net from $40 costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Note</b>As stressed by Brandburger &amp; Harborne, there must be well defined prices elsewhere in the economy (i.e. outside the modeled vertical chain) to allow the assessment of the willingness to pay and willingness to sell.</p>

<h3 id="value-creation-and-appropriation">Value Creation and Appropriation</h3>

<p>The value created by the vertical chain is the difference between customer&rsquo;s willingness to pay and supplier&rsquo;s opportunity cost.</p>

<p><strong>Bargaining</strong> between the players determine the how much vaue each player can capture and appropriate.</p>

<p>Price, consumer surplus, supplier surplus</p>

<h3 id="notion-of-value-network">Notion of Value Network</h3>

<p>The classical view is that firms should operate in a clearly defined segment. Firms that belong to the same segment are competitors and they interact with suppliers &amp; customers.</p>

<p>Brandenburger and Nalebuff (&nbsp;

    
    
<a href="/biblio/index.html#b">[Brandenburger96]</a>

&nbsp;)
 two game theorists, offer a different perspective. Their central idea is that „You don’t have to blow the other fellow’s light to let your own shine” (B. Baruch). Most busi- nesses do benefit from the success of other players and Mutual success often exceeds Rivalry.</p>

<p>With the Value Net approach, companies can <strong>cooperate to grow the pie</strong> before they <strong>compete to share it</strong>. You can often be better off by collaborating with others to make the pie bigger (even if your share remain stable in percentage) rather than claiming a bigger part of a fixed pie (i.e. stealing from somebody else).</p>


<div class="notices tip" ><p>„A player is a <strong>complementor</strong> if its value proposition increases the perceived value of your product / service” [Brandburger96]</p>
</div>


<p>Intel and Microsoft are <em>complementors</em> for the PC market. More performant microprocessors as well as more powerful operating systems increase the value of PC. Likewise, content providers (e.g. music producers) are complementors to i-Tunes: the more artists available for download, the more value for end-users.</p>


<div class="notices tip" ><p>„Economists call this a <strong>network effect</strong> (positive externality) or a <strong>demand-side economies if scale</strong>. When the network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the total number of customers using it&rdquo;.</p>
</div>


<p>Products or services that highly depend on network effect (i.e. multi-sided models) are very sensitive to quickly achieving the critical mass of users and enjoying positive feedback. Successful Value Propositions can benefit from a <em>bandwagon effect</em> where the rate of adoption becomes proportional to the number of people who are already using the system.</p>


<div class="notices tip" ><p>„The opposite effect (i.e. the value of a product decrease with the number of users) is called negative network effect or <strong>congestion</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>


<p>Sometimes, the same company can launch products that are complementors to their main business. Michelin – the tyre manufacturer – produced maps and touristic guides to encourage car trips and increase wear and tear of tyre.</p>

<p>Companies may fail to enter a market for lake of complementors. Brandenburger and Nalebuff mention the examples of Alfa Romeo and Fiat – two Italian car makers – who sought to enter the American market but had to throw the towel because no distribution / repair network was available (and establishing one was far too expensive).</p>

<p>Competition must be understood in its broad sense, that is including incumbent players but also new potential players and substitutes. As already discussed in the chapter about Value Proposition, the key question should be: <em>what else my customers could buy to serve the same need</em>.</p>

<h3 id="example-the-value-network-of-tsm">Example: The Value Network of TSM</h3>

<p>Considering the case of an University (e.g. Toulouse Graduate School of Management in the role of the Company), yield to the following roles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Customers</strong> <em>Students</em> are obvious customers (both current and prospective students). In addition the <em>Families</em> of the students (mainly their parents) would also be considered as customers. Likewise potential <em>Employers</em> should be contemplated as customers (with a different value proposition).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Competitors</strong> other <em>Education Institutions</em> (Universities, Schools, etc) are obvious competitors. Other <em>Faculties</em> from the same University would also to some extend be competitors. <em>MOOC</em> (Massive On-Line Open Course) and more generally <em>distance learning</em> should be looked at as competitors.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Complementors</strong> Some competitors could as well be complementors through a better alignment of offerings: MOOC, Universities. The availability of Housing, Entertainment, Cultural offers and an efficient Transportation System typically increase the Value Proposition of a University. Likewise the availability of part-time jobs for students or student loans could as well increase the University’s Value Proposition.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Suppliers</strong> The Faculty and teachers are obvious suppliers to the University. Book publishers and training material producers would as well be suppliers. In addition, Sponsors, Donators, the State and local administrations should as well be considered as suppliers.</p></li>
</ul>
