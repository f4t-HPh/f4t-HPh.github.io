	"content": " Practitioner\u0026rsquo;s Perspective on Strategy This site is used as training material for Master\u0026rsquo;s level courses that I teach at the Graduate School of Management  from Toulouse University.\nThe course was created in 2009 and initially was dedicated to very practical aspects. However I quickly observed that most students (as well as many managers):\n often struggle with many underlying concepts, while usually being familiar with strategic management jargon;\n often prefer qualitative approaches and have more difficulties with quantitative aspects;\n are looking for \u0026lsquo;ready-to-use\u0026rsquo; recipes and expect some sort of \u0026lsquo;automated process\u0026rsquo;.\n  In 2013, I released an expanded version, known by several cohorts of students as \u0026ldquo;the booklet\u0026rdquo;, that included definitions for the key notions (even those that are deemed known), provided some insight about business economics and corporate finance, and last but not least, introduced the fundamentals of corporate development.\nOver the years, more and more contents have be added (while I also stopped to use some others). The booklet became a website in 2018. If I may paraphrase P. Drucker ( [Druker85] ) this site seeks to equip the reader with (some of) \u0026ldquo;the understanding, the thinking, the knowledge and the skills for strategy formulation\u0026rdquo;.\nPlease note that, this site is neither a textbook nor is intended to replace one. Students interested in the field of strategic management and/or are planning to pursue a career in strategy/consulting are invited to consider these lines as a starting point for a broader journey. The bibliography  contains some very good entry points for further reading.\nPlease note as well that the views expressed herein are those of the author. They have not been endorsed by TSM or the University of Toulouse and do not necessarily reflect their opinions.\n"
