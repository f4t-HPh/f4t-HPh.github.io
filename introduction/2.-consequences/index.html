<h2 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity</h2>

<p>Practitioners have to deal with &lsquo;Ambiguity&rsquo; considering that the word strategy holds a variety of meanings and strategy-making also comes in a vast variety of tastes.</p>

<p>No single definition of &lsquo;<em>what strategy should be</em>&rsquo; is accepted (various people may have different perceptions or expectations). Therefore, dealing with strategy elaboration first and foremost requires building a <strong>shared interpretation</strong> of the problem to be solved.</p>

<p>When the problem at hand is understood, the strategist must establish as well an adequate <strong>problem solving approach</strong> and strategy development process and leadership. Indeed there is as little convergence on strategy-making that there is about ”what strategy is”.</p>

<p>Last but not least strategists must find ways to <strong>share and convey their findings</strong> and recommendations to the various stakeholders.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.019.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>

<p>Many people, from different Functions, are usually involved in crafting or updating strategies. As there is no unanimously accepted definition, different people will usually have different understandings (and possibly different expectations) of what strategy is or should be.</p>

<p>In most firms, strategy is <strong>not a standardized professional domain</strong> with it’s own recognized body of knowledge (there is no chartered strategist as there are chartered engineers or accountants).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.020.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Some scholars argue that strategic reasoning is dominantly a <strong>logical activity</strong> that hinge upon strong analytical skills. The course of action is explicitly derived from an in-depth analysis of the facts and available data.</p>

<p>However despite their seeking to be comprehensive, rigorous and systematic, strategists will hit some shortcomings and cognitive limitations. As stressed by H. Simon &ldquo;<em>people act intentionally rational but only limitedly so</em>&rdquo; 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#s">[Simon57]</a></span>
)</span>
.</p>

<p>Other thinkers are strong proponents of <strong>generative reasoning</strong>: creating new perspective, unveiling new insights and find new ways to solve problems. According to De Wit &amp; Meyer &ldquo;<em>Creative thinking should be the driving force and logical thinking a supporting means</em>&rdquo; 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#d">[DeWit10]</a></span>
)</span>
.</p>

<h3 id="unstructured-problem">Unstructured problem</h3>

<p>Strategy-making is in itself, a process of interpretation. It requires to deeply understand the problem statement, design an effective problem-solving method, discover candidate options and down select the optimal solution.</p>

<p>Although many tools exist, <strong>there is no ready-to-use recipe</strong>, no tool or framework is a silver bullet that would solve any strategic problem, and each specific case will require its own specific method.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.021.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Defining and solving strategic problem is primarily a creative activity: questions are ill-defined &amp; highly subjectives 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#r">[Ritel73]</a></span>
)</span>
. Furthermore, the classes of <strong>potential solutions are not known in advance</strong> (aka <em>wicked</em> problem). Articulating a strategy becomes then a creative reformulation of the situation.</p>

<p>For instance Jim Kecinski (former managing director at Google) stresses that one should &ldquo;<em>tap into the wisdom of crowds to drive innovation and creativity</em>&rdquo; - &ldquo;<em>framebreaking ideas can&rsquo;t be found, they have to be generated</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Sergey Brin (Google&rsquo;s co-founder) considers that most successful projects at Google have emerged bottom-up rather than being conceived top-down.</p>

<h3 id="efficient-communication">Efficient Communication</h3>

<p>Communication skills (sometimes, negotiation skills) are paramount both for facilitating the formulation of a strategy and articulating the recommendations to the decision makers.</p>

<p>This usually includes an evaluation of the proposed strategy: is the option(s) <strong>suitable</strong> in terms of matching opportunities and threats ? is it <strong>feasible</strong> and does the organization control the adequate capabilities to implement the option(s) ? is it <strong>acceptable</strong> in the eyes of the main stakeholders ?</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.022.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Once approved, a strategy must also get clearly communicated to all stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="inner-compass">Inner-compass</h2>

<p>It is essential that practitioners have their own inner-compass, their own representation of what strategy means to them. A few models (out of many others) are briefly presented hereafter.</p>

<h3 id="the-vip-model">The VIP Model</h3>

<p>According to Frédéric Fréry  
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#f">[Frery06]</a></span>
)</span>
 Strategy encompasses three major elements : <strong>value</strong>, <strong>imitation</strong> and <strong>perimeter</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a general level, strategy comprises three objectives: creating value, handling imitation and shaping a perimeter.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.023.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p><b>Value</b><br>
Strategy aims at <strong>creating sustainable value</strong> (from the perspective of customers, shareholders or more broadly any stakeholders), from which short-term and long-term over-performance can be derived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>uniqueness of strategy resides in value creation</strong>; increasing customer value beyond cost is the seminal assumption of strategy.</p>

<p>Some organizations take the view that their only responsibility is the short-term interest of shareholders. However, an exclusive focus on financial results does not necessarily align managerial and shareholder interests. Some organizations are mission driven and exclusively concentrate on demonstrating best value for their customers or users. However, this stance can threaten the long-term survival of the organization and when a business reaches effectiveness at the expense of efficiency, it contradicts its basic purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defining and assessing value is therefore of the utmost importance. In addition, it is key to understand how value is shared between the firm and its ecosystem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sound strategy must evolve between these extremes of shareholder value and customer satisfaction, profit maximization and corporate social responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, a firm must <strong>both create value and claim value</strong>. In other words, a firm must capture some of the value it creates.</p>

<p><b>Imitation </b><br>
A firm is unlikely to continue to over-perform for long, if the recipe for its success can be easily understood and copied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defining a new business model and implementing an innovative value offer is worthless if competitors can quickly catch up.</p>

<p>Achieving and <strong>sustaining success depends on the ability to be unique and remain so</strong>. That is why imitation is a central theme in strategy, whether it consists of building and defending a sustainable competitive advantage (how to avoid imitation) or, on the contrary, matching an innovator’s positioning (how to imitate a winning business model).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When firms cannot find ways of differentiation (doing different things or doing the same things differently) they run the <strong>risk of strategic convergence</strong> and industry commoditization (standardized product and offers, low margins if any).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the value of any strategic concept resides in its ability to create competitive advantage, the concept becomes irrelevant as soon as it is extensively adopted. Many best practices (ISO standards, Six Sigma, CRM) although once distinctive, have now been widely adopted.</p>

<p>Because it makes sense for competitors to mimic successful strategies, there is a great deal of similarity between organizations in many industries. Adopting new perspectives on business allow defining fresh strategic spaces by contrast to conventional business models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Perimeter</b><br>
Strategy is also deciding what to do and even more importantly what not to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beyond designing a valuable business model and managing imitation, <strong>shaping the perimeter</strong> of the organization (i.e. defining or setting the limits of its scope) is the overarching mission of strategists.</p>

<p>Decisions about diversification, outsourcing, vertical integration, internationalization and positioning, as well as defining new markets untainted by competition, are all linked with the search for a profitable perimeter.</p>

<p>Of course, strategy is not limited to choices related to the organizational scope, but conversely any alteration of the perimeter can be considered as a strategic move.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the perimeter aspects are part of <a href="/corporate/">Corporate Strategy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-dere-model">The DERE Model</h3>

<p>R. Grant 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#g">[Grant06]</a></span>
)</span>
 underlines that a sound Strategy must &ldquo;<em>encompass <strong>consistency of direction</strong>, based upon a clear understanding of the game being played, a keen awareness of how to maneuver into a <strong>position of advantage</strong> and an effectively &amp; faultless <strong>implementation</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This would remain true for strategies that don’t exist as a plan, or even are not explicitly built.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.024.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p><b> Direction </b><br>
Johnson, Whittington &amp; Scholes 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#j">[Johnson11]</a></span>
)</span>
 insist that strategy is the long-term direction of
a firm. „<em>Strategy is the long term direction of an organization. [&hellip;] The long term direction of Disney is from “Carton ” to diversified entertainment</em> ”. As such it should include deliberate and logical strategy-making elements although it can also encompass more incremental and/or emergent patterns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strategy must be guided by a simple, consistent a long term, single-minded commitment to a clearly recognized goal that is pursued steadfastly over a substantial period of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.025.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>To A. Chandler or K. Andrews, two management and corporate strategy gurus, action plans do matter but only as a means of fulfilling long-term objectives, direction or goals. Strategy setting is therefore also about defining the purpose and/or (present or future) business of a company. It flows from the determination of goals to the allocation of resources.</p>

<p>To M. Porter, strategy is about positioning: making the deliberate choice of being and behaving differently.</p>

<p><b> Environment &amp; Resources </b><br>
Formulating a successful strategy requires more than direction. Defining a compelling strategy stems from a profound understanding of the competitive environment (&ldquo;<em>a deep and insightful appreciation of the arena in which the organization is competing</em> &rdquo;) and a non-complacent appraisal of one’s own resource (&ldquo;<em>exploiting internal strength, while protecting areas of weakness</em>&rdquo;).</p>

<p><b> Execution </b><br>
Without effective implementation (or strategy execution) the best-laid strategies are of little use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The effectiveness of leaders in reaching decisions is key to success, as well as, their energy in implementing them, their effectiveness in instilling loyalty &amp; commitment among subordinates and allow effective marshaling of resources &amp; capabilities and to build organizations that promptly respond to changes in the competitive environment.

<p>Preparing detailed analyses drawing up plans, making extensive slide presentations and holding long meetings might all be necessary means, but ultimately it is the organization&rsquo;s action directed at the market-place that counts.

<h3 id="strategy-is-about-being-different">Strategy is about being different</h3>

<p>The essence of strategy is about being different and there are two ways a company can be different:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.026.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<ul>
<li><p><b>Deliver something Different</b>: offer to customer something they can&rsquo;t get elsewhere (and <em>different</em> here must not be confused with <em>better</em> - in other words differentiation is not restricted to <em>higher-end differentiation</em>).</p></li>

<li><p><b>Do things Differently</b>: find a different way to deliver the value propositions to customers. Configure the value architecture differently.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Stay Focussed</b>: to paraphrase M. Porter &ldquo;<em>don&rsquo;t try to be everything to everybody</em>&rdquo;. Be clear about what you do and equally clear about what you don&rsquo;t do.</p></li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.028.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<h2 id="strategizing">Strategizing</h2>

<h3 id="strategy-formulation">Strategy Formulation</h3>

<p>The Art of Strategy can be seen as the assessment and alignment of four components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Market opportunity</b>: <em>what the company might do</em>,</p></li>

<li><p><b>Corporate competences &amp; resources</b>: <em>what the company can do</em>,</p></li>

<li><p><b>Values &amp; aspirations</b>: <em>what the company wants to do</em>,</p></li>

<li><p><b>Acknowledgment of obligations to society</b>: <em>what the company should do</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The strategic options that get implemented, result from matching opportunity and corporate capabilities, provides that they meet the aspiration of the firm at an acceptable level of corporate responsibility.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.029.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<blockquote>
<p>It is the unity, coherence and and internal consistency of a company&rsquo;s strategic decisions that position the company in its environment and give the firm its identify, its power to mobilize its strengths, and its likelihood of success in the marketplace. - 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#a">[Andrews87]</a></span>
)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="reasons-for-not-articulating-strategy">Reasons for not articulating strategy</h3>

<p>While the unity and the coherence of a firm&rsquo;s strategy can be the result of a deliberate process corporate, it can also be the result of <em>compromise among coalitions backing contrary policy proposals, unspoken consensus, or skillful improvisatory adaptation to external forces</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Conscious planning of the long-term development of companies has been until recently less common than individual executive responses to environmental pressure, competitive threat, or entrepreneurial opportunity&rdquo;. 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#d">[DeWit10]</a></span>
)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that perspective, Strategy becomes unplanned, natural, intuitive, incremental by nature.</p>

<p>A reason for the absence of a deliberate strategic plan can be &ldquo;<em>the desirability of keeping it confidential for security reasons and ambiguous to avoid internal conflict [&hellip;] or to avoid resistance or hurting any emotional attachments</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="four-interrelated-facets">Four interrelated facets</h3>

<p><em>Strategy</em> as a practice encompasses four aspects or facets that are deeply interrelated:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.030.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<ul>
<li><p><b>Strategy Purpose</b>, as stated by De Wit &amp; Meyer, &ldquo;<em>Organisations exist to fulfill a purpose, and strategies are employed to ensure that the organisational pupose is realised and making strategies is not an end in itself but a means for reaching special objectives</em>&rdquo;.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Strategy process</b>, describes the set of activities, their sequencing as well as the roles and responsibilities of the involved stakeholders.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Strategy content</b>,  corresponds to the output (or product) of the strategy process, i.e. a formulation of the expected strategy for the firm or a course of action for achieving the firm&rsquo;s purpose.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Strategy context</b>, refers to the specific environment (within and outside the firm)in which the strategy process takes place.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The strategy process usually deeply depends on the specific context and purpose of a firm. Likewise, opting for a different process is likely to influence the strategy content.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-formulation-execution">Analysis, Formulation, Execution</h3>

<p>The strategy process is classically decomposed into three steps: the analysis, the formulation and the execution.</p>

<p>With the <b>analysis phase</b>, strategists seek to delineate and understand the situation. Next, in the <b>formulation phase</b> they look for strategic options, rank them and select one. Finally the selected option is implemented in the <b>execution phase</b>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.031.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Strategy formation is usually depicted as a three-step process : analysis, formulation and execution. :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Analysis</b> – In a first step, both internal (self evaluation) and external environment must be appraised. The analysis should encompass both macro-environmental and micro-environmental (the industry, competitors, etc) considerations. It aims at gathering facts and figures but also at figuring out trends and possible evolutions. Identification refer to al the activities contributing to a better understanding of the <em>issue</em> what constitute an important opportunity or threat, which is linked to the firm&rsquo;s mission. Most strategic issues are complex and getting some sort of understanding requires deliberate analyses. Looking at the the environment surrounding a firm is usually  called an <em>external assessment</em>, while the <em>internal assessment</em> focuses on the capabilities and internal functioning of the firm.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Formulation</b> – When their landscape is known and understood, firms produce a clear set of recommendations (or strategic plan), with sup- porting justifications. Recommendations may propose to revise and/or update the missions, goals or objectives of the organization. It is usually considered that a good recommendation should be effective in solving the problem(s) while ensuring a good level of ’fit’ between the resources and competences and the external environment. It should also be feasible within a reasonable timeframe, reasonable budget and without overly disruption for the organization. And above all, it should be (made) acceptable to the various stakeholders in the organizations. Formulation is sometimes broken down into two aspects: option generation and selection.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Option generation</b> aims at identifying and articulating potential options or avenues to address the strategic issue.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Option selection</b> consists in choosing among candidate options</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><b>Execution</b> – Once approved, a strategy must be effectively and consistently implemented by the organization. Lack of sustainable and consistent commitment is one of the major pitfalls in strategy execution and probably the first reason for strategy implementation failures.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategy-elaboration-is-also-a-social-process">Strategy Elaboration is also a &lsquo;Social Process&rsquo;</h3>

<p>The Strategy Process is often assumed to be <b>linear</b> (things are done sequentially) <strong>rational</strong> (based on rigorous logic and extensive knowledge) and <strong>comprehensive</strong> (every thing can be changed at execution time).</p>

<p>In practice however, the three steps are not as sequential as depicted by the usual ’standard process’. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to proceed by successive iterations (a bit of analysis, a bit of formulation, then back to analysis and formulation, etc). &ldquo;<em>Strategies are formed incrementally, as organizations think and act in small iterative steps, letting strategies emerge as they go along.</em>&ldquo;
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#d">[DeWit10]</a></span>
)</span>
.</p>

<p>However many academics and most practitioners now consider that the strategy process is more intuitive &amp; creative than purely rational. &ldquo;<em>Strategizing is about perceiving and envisioning and imagination &amp; judgment are more important than analysis and logic</em>&rdquo; 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#d">[DeWit10]</a></span>
)</span>
.</p>

<p>While it can occur, it is also rather rare that a company can fully redesign. &ldquo;<em>Strategy changes is usually more gradual and fragmented than radical and coordinated</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/1/1.032.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<ul>
<li><p><b>Iteration</b> – Conducting a comprehensive analysis before stepping to the formulation stage would be very time consuming and probably inefficient. Usually firms run <em>successive analysis-formulation loops</em>. Candidate strategic moves are identified (formulated) further to a first analysis. Then subsequent analysis-formulation loops are handled, to refine the candidate projects and eliminate some. When projects are considered sufficiently robust and justified, a final recommendation is made to decision makers.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Buy-In</b> – Strategic recommendations usually challenge the status quo and propose to walk out from the established comfort zone. Experience shows that when strategic recommendations are established in isolation from the rest of a firm, they are likely to be (at least at first) rejected by internal stakeholders. Strategists must therefore, leave their ivory tower and make sure that some stakeholders representing the various firm’s Functions (or departments) get involved and familiar with the analysis and formulation <em>as soon as possible</em>. However, internal stakeholders can be very complacent with the current situation and/or extremely reluctant when it comes to breakthrough changes. Strategists may choose to perform some analyses alone (or possibly with external support) to avoid distortions. These results can then be shared with other internal stakeholders to raise their awareness.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Explain</b> – Once established, a strategic recommendation must be explained first to the decision makers, then to internal stakeholders (to get it executed) and also to external stakeholders (customers, suppliers, media, shareholders, rating agencies, etc). It is paramount to make it very simple, comprehensible and as crisp as possible. If you cannot articulate your strategy in <em>a one-minute elevator ride</em>, or put it in a single piece of paper (with no buzzword, no techno-geek stuff and no implicit statement) it is likely that strategy will never get executed.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Story telling</b> – Story telling is inherent to strategic move. It is always a good sign when co-workers and/or external analysts start to ’recite’ the story. However, it would be a mistake to reduce strategy formulation to the production of catch phrases or tag lines. It is not straightforward to craft a simple, compelling story. It is usually the result of a comprehensive and deep strategic analysis.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Feedback</b> – Last but not least, it is always useful to ensure explicit feedback between execution (the strategy that get actually implemented) and formulation (the intended strategy) to control effectiveness. Discrepancies between the two can reflect changes (in the external and or internal environment), which would require adjusting the strategy formulation. It may also be the sign that the intended strategy is not rightly implemented, which also require revisiting the strategy formulation to make sure it is better understood and executed.</p></li>

<h3 id="strategy-thinking-and-cognition">Strategy thinking and cognition</h3>

<p>Strategizing involves two nature of mental activities: <b>defining strategic problems</b> and  <b>solving strategic problems</b> which broadly cover the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Identification</b> sense-making of the situation or problem</p></li>

<li><p><b>Diagnosis</b> understand the structure of the problem and its underlying cause</p></li>

<li><p><b>Formulation</b> derive potential solutions and select the preferred one.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Realise</b> undertake concrete actions to achieve the expected result(s).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>De Wit stresses that for some scholars strategic reasoning is dominantly a <strong>logical activity</strong> that hinge upon strong analytical skills. The course of action is explicitly derived from an in-depth analysis of the facts and available data. However despite their seeking to be comprehensive, rigorous and systematic, strategists will hit some shortcomings and cognitive limitations. As stressed by H. Simon &ldquo;<em>people act intentionally rational but only limitedly so</em>&rdquo; 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#s">[Simon57]</a></span>
)</span>
 &ldquo;.</p>

<p>Other thinkers are strong proponents of <strong>generative reasoning</strong>: creating new perspective, unveiling new insights and find new ways to solve problems. According to them &ldquo;<em>Creative thinking should be the driving force and logical thinking a supporting means</em>&rdquo;. Defining and solving strategic problem is primarily a creative activity: questions  are ill-defined &amp; highly subjectives and furthermore, the classes of potential solutions are not known in advance (aka <em>wicked</em> problem 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#r">[Ritel73]</a></span>
)</span>
).</p>

<p>Articulating a strategy then becomes a creative reformulation of the situation.  For instance Jim Kecinski (Managing director at Google) stresses that one should &ldquo;<em>tap into the wisdom of crowds to drive innovation and creativity</em>&rdquo; - &ldquo;<em>framebreaking ideas can&rsquo;t be found, they have to be generated</em>&rdquo;. Sergey Brin (Google&rsquo;s co-founder) considers that most successful projects at Google have emerged bottom-up rather than being conceived top-down.</p>

<h3 id="strategic-change">Strategic Change</h3>

<p>The alignment of firms with their environment is a dynamic balance. It constantly evolves and firms have to change to <em>stay alive</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While change is pervasive, not all change in firms is strategic in nature. Much of the change witnessed is actually the operational kind (i.e. directed at increasing the performance of the firm within the confines of the existing system)

<p><strong>Strategic changes</strong> (aka <em>Strategic renewal</em>) have an impact on how a company makes business and/or on how it configures its capabilities. Strategic renewal can be characterized by the magnitude of change (incremental vs step change) and by the pace of change (continuous &amp; evolutionary vs. abrupt &amp; radical).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to achieve strategic renewal it is essential to turn away from the firm&rsquo;s heritage and to start with a clean slate. On the other hand, to achieve lasting strategic renewal, people in the organisation need time to learn, adapt and grow , building on past experiences, investments  and loyalties.

<p>Big bang approaches (radical and disruptive) may be necessary when organizational rigidity is so deep that small increments can create the momentum and move the needle.</p>

<p>Firms are complex systems.
The business system refers to the way &lsquo;<em>a firm makes money</em>&lsquo;: it is a configuration of inputs, outputs (value proposition) and activities (thoughput) intended to create value for customers.<br />
The organisational system refers to &lsquo;<em>the way a firm carries out the business</em>&rsquo; (i.e. how the individuals populating the firm have been configured and relate to one another, with the intention of facilitating the business system.)</p>

<p>The organisation system is often further decomposed into its structure (anatomy), its processes (physiology) and its culture (pyschology) 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#b">[Bartlett]</a></span>
)</span>
.</p>

<p>The <strong>organisation structure</strong> depicts how the organisation is configured in smaller parts and reflects the division of labour (i.e. how to deliver value effectively and efficiently). The structure of an organisation can hinge on its inputs (e.g. structured by core inputs or supply-chain channels), its transformation processes (e.g. structured by nature of value-adding activities, transformation technologies, locations) or its outputs (e.g. by groups of clients, by product-markets, by brands, by distribution channels).</p>

<p>The <strong>organisational processes</strong> depict the arrangements, procedures, and mechanisms used to control and coordinate the various people and sub-structures. Processes can span the full organisation of by contrast, remain very local to some activities. Not all processes are formalized, and very often there is a full set of implicit processes and routines alongside formal processes.</p>

<p>The <strong>organisation culture</strong>  corresponds to behavioural patterns shared by the members of an organisation. It includes values and norms, which play as a common interpretative filter of the surrounding environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Culture can act as a strong integration mechanism, controlling and coordinating people&rsquo;s behaviour, by getting them abide by &lsquo;the way we do things around here&rsquo;. 
<span class="cite">(

    
    
<span class="ci"><a href="/biblio/index.html#d">[DeWit10]</a></span>
)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some sort of integration mechanism is needed to balance the horizontal differentiation of tasks. The formal authority (hierarchy) is one of those.</p>
