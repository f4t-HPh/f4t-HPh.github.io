      <description>Introduction Corporate Strategy aims at finding out if a company should, and if so, how it should compete across several industries.
 Corporate Strategy is about selecting an optimal set of businesses and determining how they should be integrated into the corporate whole - De Wit &amp;amp; Meyer
 Corporate Strategy being about multi-businesses, it becomes key to define what a &amp;lsquo;business&amp;rsquo; is. The usual accepted definition is that a a business is characterized by its business model.</description>

      <description>Strategy elaboration is likely to mobilize a wide variety of techniques, involve staff from various functional origins and last from a few weeks to several months. It is therefore paramount to plan and organize the work to ensure that resources and means are aligned with expectations and constraints.
Preparing a report, within a week, on the structure of an industry is not comparable with elaborating, along several months, a full diversification strategy.</description>

      <description>What does Strategy mean? “Strategy” in everyday’s conversations In everyday conversations the word strategy far exceeds the domain of strategic management. Considering just a glimpse of the many different meanings, at least three specific contexts can be stressed, in addition to strategic management: strategic thinking, problem solving and important things.
   Strategy for Important it is very common to hear about strategic customers, strategic suppliers, strategic country, strategic campaign, strategic project, etc.</description>

      <description>As we will see later, a value proposition is at the interface between the firm and its customers, it is characterized by a mix of attributes (e.g. price, availability, reliability, technical specifications, image, ease of use, etc&amp;hellip;). For a transaction to take place the value proposition of a firm must be valued by a customer (willingness to pay) at a level that exceeds the price requested by the firm.</description>

      <title>What is a Business Model?</title>

      <description>There are many definitions of the concept of Business Model.
In a nutshell, a BM is a simplified representation of a business that stresses both the intent and inner logic ( [Osterwalder10] ) .
  A Business Model  is „the set of mechanisms by which a company can create value through the value proposition made to its customers, its value architecture and capture that value to turn it into profits” [Lehmann-Ortega].</description>

      <description>Performance difference is not the rule in all industries and although differences may exist, they are often short lived. Nevertheless some firms, in many different industries, in many different countries and contexts, are doing better than others.
Competitive Advantage Understanding the conditions and factors that control over-performance, has taken center stage in business strategy.
„An enterprise has a competitive advantage if it is able to create more economic value than the marginal (break-even) competitor in its product market, where economic value is the difference between the perceived benefits gained by the purchasers of the firm’s goods or services and the economic cost to the enterprise.</description>

      <description>Ambiguity Practitioners have to deal with &amp;lsquo;Ambiguity&amp;rsquo; considering that the word strategy holds a variety of meanings and strategy-making also comes in a vast variety of tastes.
No single definition of &amp;lsquo;what strategy should be&amp;rsquo; is accepted (various people may have different perceptions or expectations). Therefore, dealing with strategy elaboration first and foremost requires building a shared interpretation of the problem to be solved.
When the problem at hand is understood, the strategist must establish as well an adequate problem solving approach and strategy development process and leadership.</description>

      <description>Growth motivations There are very many reasons (good or sometimes questionable) why a company would seek to grow. If we forget fashion effects or &amp;lsquo;prestige&amp;rsquo; motivations it all fall down to three major aspirations:
 Getting access to resources that the mother company needs and that cannot be optained efficiently from markets
 Financial optimisation that will mostly appeal to Financila investores by also sometimes to CFOs of large coorporations</description>

      <description>Every problem contains within itself
the seeds of its own solution.
 Stanley Arnold   “ The world as we have created it, is a process of our thinking.
it cannot be changed without changing our thinking.
 Albert Einstein   “ Stop thinking and end your problems.
 Lao Tzu  One might be tempted to believe that “thinking” (whether individually or in groups) is a quite natural process, which does not require any special precaution.</description>

      <description>A Value proposition is the description of the offer (product or service) made by a company to its customer and why the offer is attractive to customers.
 One of the central questions in Strategy is: which value proposition should be developed? to serve which customer segments?
   Value Propositions compete with a broad set of substitutes. Customers, through their behaviors and consumption logic, determine which companies are actually competing.</description>

      <description>On the fringe of the two dominant orthodox models (the market-based and resource-based theories) several frameworks have been introduced. They’ve not all made it through. However some frameworks (eg. Blue Ocean Strategy by W. Chan Kim &amp;amp; Renée Mauborgne or Delta model by A. Hax) are becoming popular and are considered valid alternatives or at least good supplements to the dominant models.
  In Hax&amp;rsquo;s words ( [Hax01] ) :</description>

      <description>Selecting Options Strategy is about making choice, about allocating resource to the best projects or strategic options.
A firm usually faces several options : for instance developing new products or entering a new business (diversification). Not all the options can be pursued at the same time (remember scarcity of resources). The firm needs to prioritize the various options and down-select the few it wants to implement.
  Even a single strategy elaboration project can produce more than one proposal.</description>

      <description>Bargaining &amp;amp; Value Capture Any firm, whether it produces products or services, transforms some inputs into outputs. Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables. Firms acquire the inputs from their suppliers in upstream markets and deliver their products or services to their direct customers in downstream markets.
 The transformation process may also require Capital Equipment, items (e.g. machinery, intellectual property) that are not transformed in the process and can be used repeatedly.</description>

      <description>Even when it is explicitly formulated, a strategy does include detailed actions for all stakeholders. On the contrary, it should focus on top level considerations and ensure alignment, while leaving a lot of freeway to the people in charge of executing.
  Organization alignment D. Sull &amp;amp; K.M. Eisenhardt ( [Sull15] ) have rightly pointed out that if an organization’s strategy lives on the shelf then this organization has a problem.</description>

      <description>The notion of strategic interaction is one of the core concepts for strategic thinking.
Let’s assume there is a buffet and we all rush to the refreshments. As a consequence when the last two persons arrive there is only one cup of tea left. These two persons both have two options: either take or don’t take the tea.
  This can be represented by a table or matrix, where the rows correspond to one person’s actions and the columns to the other’s.</description>

      <description>Ex-post narrative - the Honda Case The now famous Honda Case is a perfect illustration of the difference between deliberate and emergent strategies. It also proves that convincing ex-post stories can be built by analysts who try to report and make intelligible the successful strategic moves and/or missed opportunities of firms.
However, it seems that, in that case (but in how many more ?) the ex-post explanations had totally reconstructed the initial strategic intends and/or deviate from the hard facts.</description>

      <description>The Ansoff&amp;rsquo;s Matrix The famous Ansoff’s matrix was first published in 1957 in the Harvard Business Review. It portrays the four alternative growth strategies, by considering existing products vs. new products, and existing markets vs. new markets.
  Market penetration consists in increasing the business through offering the same product/service to the same market. Market development and Product development are sometimes called related diversification (or adjacent diversification). The idea here is to either offer new products to existing customers or to propose existing products to new markets.</description>

      <description>Any firm, whether it produces products or services, transforms some inputs into outputs (aka Value Propositions). Inputs typically range from raw-materials, labour, intermediate products, consumables.
 Note: the transformation process may also require items (e.g. machinery) that can be used repeatedly. Such items are called Capital Equipment and are not transformed in the process.
 Economists call inputs factors and say that firm combine factors. They also represent the transformation as a so called production function.</description>

      <description>VISION
Strategy is what determines the framework of a firm&amp;rsquo;s business activities and provides guidelines for coordinating activities so that the firm can cope with and influence the changing environment. Strategy articulates the firm&amp;rsquo;s preferred environment and the type of organization it is striving to become - Hiroyuki Itami.
Mission &amp;ldquo;the enduring set of fundamental principles (including the core values, believes, functioning habits) outlining what purpose the organisation wishes to serve, in what domain and under which conditions&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Business Case One may argue that preparing business cases does not strictly fall within the scope of strategy, and even less of corporate strategy. There are however at least three reasons for looking at business cases as part of strategy elaboration:
 Value: strategic moves are about generating value. Although value must here be understood in its widest sense, many stakeholders (starting with shareholders) will measure value in terms of the financial impact.</description>
