      <description>Selecting Options Strategy is about making choice, about allocating resource to the best projects or strategic options.
A firm usually faces several options : for instance developing new products or entering a new business (diversification). Not all the options can be pursued at the same time (remember scarcity of resources). The firm needs to prioritize the various options and down-select the few it wants to implement.
  Even a single strategy elaboration project can produce more than one proposal.</description>

      <description>The Ansoff&amp;rsquo;s Matrix The famous Ansoffâ€™s matrix was first published in 1957 in the Harvard Business Review. It portrays the four alternative growth strategies, by considering existing products vs. new products, and existing markets vs. new markets.
  Market penetration consists in increasing the business through offering the same product/service to the same market. Market development and Product development are sometimes called related diversification (or adjacent diversification). The idea here is to either offer new products to existing customers or to propose existing products to new markets.</description>
