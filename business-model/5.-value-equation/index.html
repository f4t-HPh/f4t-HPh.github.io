<h2 id="business-case">Business Case</h2>

<p>One may argue that preparing business cases does not strictly fall within the scope of strategy, and even less of corporate strategy. There are however at least three reasons for looking at business cases as part of strategy elaboration:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Value</strong>: strategic moves are about generating value. Although value must here be understood in its widest sense, many stakeholders (starting with shareholders) will measure value in terms of the financial impact.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Investment</strong>: strategic moves will also require mobilizing and/or acquiring resources. Financial resources and investments will be under the scrutiny of the Chief Financial Officer, and it is very unlikely that any significant investment can be allowed without a sound financial justification.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>ACID Test</strong>: the most common excuse for people who fail to elaborate a business case is &lsquo;<em>it is strategic</em>&rsquo; (meaning it is so important that is doesn&rsquo;t even need to be justified). Likewise it is not uncommon to discover that a supposedly competitive advantage turns out to be undetectable when translated into figures.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of business strategy is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of a business, i.e. its future cashflows appropriately discounted for their timing and riskness.

<div class="notices note" ><p>In strategy, the objective of business case is to substantiate the qualitative orientations with quantitative forecasts.</p>
</div>


<p>Figures (usually orders of magnitudes) can then get connected and compared with business-as-usual operations. This chapter briefly presents how to put together a financial business case and introduces some key concepts of Corporate Finance.</p>

<h3 id="revenue-streams">Revenue Streams</h3>

<p>A business case encompasses two main items: forecasted revenues and forecasted costs. More precisely it consists of a time series of revenues and costs streams. This section addresses revenue aspects while costs are dealt with hereafter.</p>

<p>A <a href="../2.-value-proposition/">Value Proposition</a> identifies a clear revenue stream, addressing a dedicated customer segment. A firm with a simple business model will offer a single value proposition and address a single customer segment. It will therefore see a single revenue stream. For more complex models each revenue stream (associated to a value proposition / customer group must) must be analyzed separately. The total revenue is then the aggregation of all the streams.</p>

<p><b> Revenue Types </b><br>
Business cases are built from the <strong>cash flows</strong> (the money actually received or paid) associated to revenue streams and expense streams.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.079.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>It is therefore key to clarify both how much is paid by customers and when payments occur (e.g. periodically subscription vs on-the-go payments).</p>

<p><b> Model of the demand </b><br>
The second step consists in forecasting the level of demand for each Value Pro- position / Customer Group (i.e. how much products will be consumed by the customers and when).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.080.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Models should be kept as simple as possible and should rely on only a very few parameters. The goal is two-fold : evaluate the order of magnitude for the demand and identify the (few) factors that may affect positively or adversely demand.</p>

<p><b> Revenue Estimates</b><br>
Once demand &amp; pricing are estimated, it is possible to compute (for each value proposition / customer segment) the forecasted revenues, based on demand (how many units) and on pricing (how much per unit).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.081.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>When there are several value propositions, inflation must be treated consistently (either nominal cash flows or real should be used across all lines). Likewise, in case of international exchanges, foreign currency must be dealt with (usually by converting all currencies into one reference currency).</p>


<div class="notices note" ><p>The goal is not to produce complex and sophisticated tables of figures. On the contrary the objective is to have a simple while relevant model of how revenues can develop with time.</p>
</div>


<h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>

<p>The term Cost has a variety of meanings. Accountants, economists or production engineers have their own (and sometimes conflicting) understanding of what costs are or should be.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.082.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>By and large, costs can be broken down into relevant (for a project), irrelevant, unavoidable (they would be incurred regardless of whether the project is implemented or not) and avoidable.</p>

<p>A <strong>sunk cost</strong> is a cost that has already been incurred and has no alternative use at the time when the decision to implement or not a project is being made. Once spent, sunk costs should not be considered as they are irrelevant to the decision to implement or not additional projects : sunk costs are paid independently of accepting or rejecting the projects. Therefore it should not be accounted in the cash flow stream of the projects. However, for a given project, some of the costs that will be spent only if the project is launched can be sunk costs. In that later case, despite being sunk they should be accounted with the project.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb consists in defining a reference situation (aka AS IS situation). The costing of any new project should start from this reference and consider all additional costs as well as all opportunities to reduce existing costs (i.e. make savings). When a sunk cost has already been paid it is lost and cannot be saved (hence cannot been accounted as saving). When a sunk cost is necessary but has not yet been paid it is an additional cost and needs to be accounted as such.</p>

<p>According to economists, an <strong>opportunity cost</strong> corresponds to the loss of cash inflows due to the project. If a firm uses its own building to host the project, then it waives the revenues it could generate by renting this building. The revenues that the firm could earn if they don&rsquo;t undertake the project (revenues associated to the baseline scenario) should be counted as costs for the project (differential cash flow compared to the reference situation). Likewise, there is an opportunity cost if the project would cause <b>sales erosion</b> on some other businesses of the firm (cannibalization).</p>

<p>In finance, the term opportunity cost of capital often refers to the cost of tying up cash into the firm (that is the return expected by the equity and debt holders).</p>

<p>The <strong>ownership costs</strong> correspond to the cost of owning (or lending) an asset plus the cost of using it (maintenance, consumable, insurance, &hellip; ). It is extensively used by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) to justify that a higher price can be compensated by lower usage costs. Obviously computing ownership costs requires a deep understanding of the forecasted usage profile.</p>

<p>Depending on the product / service, ownership costs may include start-up costs (e.g. customization of the product, integration in the firm environment, initial training, etc..). If the product / service replaces a previous product / services cancellation fees or penalties can be due. A switching cost is the cost, incurred by a customer, to change supplier. The higher this cost, the more difficult for a customer to change supplier. Sometimes suppliers (e.g. cell phone operators) will subsidize customers and reimburse the switching costs (e.g. in exchange for time commitment).</p>

<p><strong>Transaction costs</strong> correspond to all the costs associated with searching, selecting and contracting a product / service. It is a cost for the customer although it is not paid to the supplier (not in the product / service price). Transaction costs are minimal for commodities. They can rapidly grow for very specific products/projects that require technical and contractual specifications.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.083.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Depreciation expenses should not be considered as only cash flows are relevant to compute a business case. However, as depreciations have an effect on after-tax cash flows, depreciation impact on taxes may be considered if relevant. Likewise, the additional taxes the firm would have to pay as a result of the project and/or tax reductions that may be granted should be considered.</p>


<div class="notices note" ><p>Financing costs are cash flows to the investors and not cash flow from the project. The cost of capital (which is used to discount future cash flows) already account for the cost of financing the project.</p>
</div>


<p>Therefore financing costs (e.g. interest payment) should not be considered in the cash flow stream of the project.</p>

<h3 id="cash-profile">Cash Profile</h3>

<p>The <strong>break even</strong> period correspond to the lead-time to balance the cumulated costs with the cumulated revenues. The maximum exposure is the minimum value of the cumulated net cash (this is the amount that needs to be invested before the firm can balance revenues and costs and generate some positive cashflow).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.085.jpeg"/> 
</figure>



<div class="notices note" ><p>It is noteworthy that making profit and generating cash are two distinct concepts.</p>
</div>


<p>A business can make profit even if it still requires and burns cash. Conversely a business can generate cash but make losses from an accounting standpoint (e.g. due to depreciation and amortization).</p>

<p><b>Sensitivity Analysis</b><br>
It is often useful to simulate the impact that variations on the main parameters would have on the cash profile (exposure, break even, total cash after 10 years, etc).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.086.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>When the cash profile depends on several parameters e.g. \( f(t, x1, x2, x3) \), these parameters should usually not be used directly for the sensitivity analysis. It is often more appropriated to define a few scenarios (e.g. S1, S2, S3, S4) and then determine what would be the values of the parameters under each scenario e.g. \( (x_1^1, x^1_2, x^1_3), (x^2_1, x^2_2, x^2_3), &hellip;, (x^4_1, x^4_2, x^4_3) \).</p>

<p>A cash flow profile can then be computed for each scenario.</p>

<h3 id="discounted-business-case">Discounted Business Case</h3>

<p><b>Time Value for Money</b><br>
One euro today is not worth one euro tomorrow as today&rsquo;s euro can be invested (in a risk free security) and yield some interest payment. Discounting is therefore the symmetrical operation to capitalizing.
The same principal can be applied over a longer period of time and the &lsquo;present value&rsquo; of a value V in i years is : \( PV = \frac{V}{(1+d)^i} \) where d is the discount rate.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.087.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>In theory, the discount rate d varies with time: the discount rate from year \( n \)  to  \( n + 1 \)  might not be the same than the discount rate \( n + 1  \) to \( n + 2  \).
Practically however, business cases are discounted with constant discount rate.</p>

<p>Orthodox finance claims that WACC + hurdle should be used as discount rate, where WACC is the weighted average cost of capital and hurdle represents the specific risks associated to the project.</p>

<p><b>Comparing projects</b><br>
Methods such as NPV, IRR and payback period are used to compare candidate projects and select the most promising. NPV is considered the most robust method.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.088.jpeg"/> 
</figure>



<div class="notices note" ><p>A project that yields a positive NPV is creating value. The bigger the NPV, the bigger the value.</p>
</div>


<p>The project <strong>profitability index</strong> is the ratio of the NPV to the initial cash outlay. In the selection process, the firm should select projects with the highest productivity index until it has allocated the total amount of funds.</p>

<h2 id="return-on-investment">Return on Investment</h2>

<p>Return on Investment (ROI) is a broad term that encompasses many different ways of measuring the performance of an investment.
In general the absolute values of indicators are not meaningful per se. Instead, indicators are used to compare the performance of a firm to other firms from the same industry or across industries. Indicators can also be used to assess performance evolution over time.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.089.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>A &lsquo;Return&rsquo; on &lsquo;Investment&rsquo; ratio is always some sort of fraction where the numerator measures the performance of a firm  and the denominator measures a level of investment.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.095.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>This sections briefly looks at some classical indicators. To do so, it first addresses management accounting, a way to present the accounts of a company that is meaningful for management and corporate finance.</p>

<h3 id="accounting-balance-sheet">Accounting Balance Sheet</h3>

<p>The balance sheet identifies at a specific date the company&rsquo;s assets and the claims to those assets by creditors and owners.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.090.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>On its left side, a balance sheet lists the company&rsquo;s assets (i.e. the uses of the funds, what the company owns: equipment, cash, inventories, money due from customers). On the right side, the balance sheet lists the claims to those assets by the owners and creditors (i.e. the sources of funds, what the company owe to its shareholders, debt holders and suppliers).</p>

<p><b> Equity and Liabilities </b><br>
Equity represents the contribution by owners to a business, along with any profits that are kept in the business. The contribution provides resources to the company and represents a claim by the owner to profits earned by the business. Debts (financial or operational) correspond to money that was invested in the business while not owned by the business&rsquo;s owners</p>

<p>It consists in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Capital</strong> (at book value) existing share times nominal value.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Premiums</strong> when issuing additional capital, investors will have to pay a premium to be allowed to join the business. The actual price of such shares is premium + nominal value.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Retain earnings</strong> the accumulated profits that have been re-invested in the business, yearly incremented (or decremented) by the net profit minus the dividends paid to shareholders</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Financial debt</strong> Borrowing is another source of money for a company, let at the company&rsquo;s disposal by financial actors - for a limited period of time - to help the corporation finance its operations. Creditors (lenders) have a claim for repayment of amounts the company borrowed (the principal of the loan) and for interests on amounts borrowed. Two types of debts are considered, according to their maturity: Long-term debt (supposed to be repaid in more than one year) and Short-term debt (will be repaid within next year which creates a liquidity risk and pressure on cash position). Short Term debts include notes payable, bank overdrafts, lines of credit. The portion of any long term debt due within a year is also considered a short term obligation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Operating current liabilities</strong> by contrast; corresponds to liabilities generated by the business operations and covering several items: Taxes &amp; social security expenses (that the company must pay but hasn&rsquo;t paid yet), Accounts payable, Dividend payable, Accrued expenses.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Account Payable</strong> are liabilities to the suppliers of the company. it arises because the company doesn&rsquo;t pay immediately the products and services it uses. There is a time lag between the receipt of goods and payment for them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Accrued Expenses</strong>  are liabilities associated to the company&rsquo;s operations (other than short debt debt and account payable). It includes for instance, wage and taxes that are due but have not been paid on the date of the balance sheet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><b> Assets </b><br>
Broadly speaking, there are three categories of assets : Tangibles (physical assets), Intangibles (software, patents, trademarks, goodwill) and Financial (e.g. equity invested in non-integrated subsidiaries). Tangible assets are deprecated and Intangible assets are amortized over time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fixed assets</strong> equipment (machine, pieces of software, technology) purchased to allow the organization to reach its strategic goals and not renewed at the rate of the operating cycle. As some of the long-term assets are âconsumedâ by the operating cycle, they depreciate and therefore the net asset value correspond to the initial value minus the cumulated depreciation and/or amortization over the years.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Operating Current Assets</strong> are those short-term as- sets used to support the operations of a business. In most organizations, the key operating current assets accounts receivable and all forms of inventory (work in progress at various stages).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Account Receivable</strong> record the invoices that have not been paid yet by customers at the date of the balance sheet. Accounts Receivable are debts ow- ned to the company by its customers. When customers pay their bills, this asset will be converted into cash.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Pre-paid Expenses</strong> correspond to payments already made by the company although the corresponding products or services will be received after (or extend beyond) the date of the balance sheet. For instance, the payment of an insurance policy is usually due in advance and therefore is recorded as pre-paid expenses.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Inventory</strong> are goods (raw materials, finished and semi-finished products) held by the company for future delivery. A manufacturing company has normally three inventory lines in its balanced sheet : raw material, work in progress and finished good.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Cash &amp; Cash Equivalent</strong> encompasses cash in hand, deposit with banks and short-term investments (marketable securities) with maturity not exceeding on year. Sometimes, Cash is subtracted from financial debts which gives the net financial debts.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="management-balance-sheet">Management Balance sheet</h3>

<p>The so-called Management Balance Sheet is obtained from the Accounting Balance sheet through moving items (mostly operating debts) from left to right or vice versa (by subtracting the same amount on both side).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.091.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>The two sides of the management balance sheet still sum-up to the same amount.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.092.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>The big interest of the management balance sheet is that it delineate blocks on which specific and distinct management actions can be carried out.</p>

<h3 id="ways-to-finance-the-business">Ways to finance the business</h3>

<p>For any business there are four main sources of financing:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.093.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<ul>
<li><p><strong>Equity</strong> financing can be brought by shareholders either when the firm is incorporated or later during its development.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Debt firms</strong> can borrow money from banks or if its size is sufficient directly from the market (e.g. through bond emission).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Profit</strong> If a firm makes profit, it can retain its earnings and self fund its development</p></li>

<li><p><strong>WCR Reduction</strong> decreasing WCR reduces the need for further financing. In addition, if WCR becomes negative (e.g. Account Payable &gt; Ac- count Receivable) then it becomes a true source of financing (e.g. supplier are lending money for free).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Reducing the Working Capital Requirement </b><br></p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.094.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Supplier credit contribute to finance the business (and is free of charge).</p>

<h3 id="return-on-sales">Return On Sales</h3>

<p>ROS (Return On Sales) measures the net earnings as a proportion of the revenue. In other words it assesses how much the firm capture value.
\[ ROS = \frac{EAT}{Sales} \]</p>


<div class="notices note" ><p>While this is not per se a &lsquo;return on investment&rsquo;, the ROS measures how efficiently a business can turn sales into profit.</p>
</div>


<p>The definition may however vary and the ROS can be a synonym for either the net profit margin (EAT over Sales) or the profit margin  (EBIT over Sales).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.096.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>It is prudent to always clarify the definition (e.g. by stating EBIT over Revenue) and make sure that the definition is used consistently. It is therefore highly recommended to always recompute indicators rather than using pre-computed indicators from different sources (e.g. web sites) and running the risk that different formulas were used.</p>

<h3 id="return-on-assets-and-return-on-equity">Return on Assets and Return on Equity</h3>

<p>The ROA (Return On Assets) evaluates how effectively assets (the size of the accounting balance sheet) are used. This ratio (as many others) was designed at <a href="www.dupont.com">du Pont de Nemours &amp; company <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, in the 20&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The ROE (Return On Equity) assesses the performance of a firm (and of its management) relatively to the investment made by shareholders.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.097.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p><b> DuPont Formulas</b><br>
The DuPont formulas break down performance indicators into three elements (themselves indicators). This analysis enables to understand the source of superior return by comparison with companies in similar industries (or between industries). It also guides the establishment of an action plan when performance is insufficient.</p>

<p>The ROA can be written \( ROA = \frac{EAT}{ASSETS} = \frac{EAT}{SALES} \times \frac{SALES}{ASSETS} = ROS \times  \frac{SALES}{ASSETS} \)</p>

<p>Likewise the ROE can be writte \( ROE = \frac{EAT}{EQUITY} = ROS \times \frac{SALES}{ASSETS} \times \frac{ASSETS}{EQUITY} \)</p>

<p>Where :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Profit margin</strong> (ROS) \( \frac{EAT}{Sales} \) denotes how much the firm captures value in proportion of its turnover.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Asset turnover</strong> (or throughput) \( \frac{Sales}{Assets}\) measures how efficiently assets are used - how much assets are necessary to generate the revenues</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Financial Leverage</strong> \( \frac{Assets}{Equity}\) indicates how debt financing is used relative to equity financing - how</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are therefore fundamentally three ways to improve the ROA:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Higher profit margin</strong> Increase the ROS (e.g. raise prices or reduce operating costs) while keeping throughput constant (same volume of sale),</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Increase productivity of the assets</strong> Improve throughput and grow the sales while keeping profit margin unchanged, for the same level of assets.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Reduce assets</strong>  to yield the same level of sales with the same profit margin (e.g. sell &amp; lease back some fixed assets, reduce WCR)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Comparing Companies</b><br>
Comparing each factor with companies in similar industry (or across industries) helps improving the ROE. By and large there are three major types of industries:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>High margin industries</strong> derive their earnings from selling at high price with high margin. ROS is the dominant factor in ROE. Increasing sales while not destroying margin can be challenging (e.g. <em>haute couture</em> fashion, luxury industry)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>High turn over industries</strong> certain sectors yield very little margins (e.g.retailing, low-cost businesses, &hellip;) but have very high turnover and can sell a significant multiple of their assets per year.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>High leverage industries</strong> some industries can rely on very high leverage (e.g. financial sector) while offering rather small profit margin or asset turnover.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roce">ROCE</h3>

<p>While ROE and ROA are computed from the Accounting Balance Sheet, ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) is derived from the Management Balance Sheet.</p>


<div class="notices note" ><p>The objective of the ROCE is to focus on the economic value created (or destroyed) independently of the accurate structure of the income statement and balance sheet.</p>
</div>


<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.092.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p><b>NOPAT</b><br>
Non-operating and financial activities (non-recurring gain or losses) can significantly influence the net income of a firm on a given year. Likewise, interest expense depends on the financial leverage (how much debt) and do not reflect the performance of operations.</p>


<div class="notices note" ><p>NOPAT is a way to approximate what a firm earns from its operations. NOPAT approximates earnings before interest after taxes (EBIAT).</p>
</div>


<p>\[ EBT = EBIT - I \]
\[ EAT = EBT.(1 - T_r) = (EBIT - I) (1 - T_r) \]
\[ EAT = EBIT.(1-T_r) - I.(1-T_r)\]
\[ NOPAT = EIBT.(1-T_r) \]</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that very often the ROCE is computed from the EBIT instead of the NOPAT. This may be an issue when comparing firms that are not exposed to the same (average) tax rate.</p>

<p><b>ROCE</b><br>
ROCE measures the NOPAT relatively to the size of the management balance sheet.</p>

<p>Sometimes, analysts use what they call a <em>pre-tax ROCE</em> which is in fact ROS over CE.</p>


<div class="notices note" ><p>The ROCE compares what is earned from operations to how much the business needs to run its operations.</p>
</div>


<p>\[ ROCE = \frac{NOPAT}{CE} = \frac{EBIT}{CE} . (1-T_r) \]</p>

<p>One of the main drawback of ROCE is that Capital Employed represents the book value of assets. As a consequence, the ROCE tends to increase with time as assets depreciate and Capital Employed decreases. Longstanding businesses will therefore have higher ROCE than newer ventures.</p>

<p>In addition, earnings are affected by inflation and will mechanically increase with time while Capital Employed will not. Consequently analyzing the evolution of the ROCE of a company over time can be quite challenging.</p>

<p><b> ROCE decomposition</b><br></p>

<h3 id="economic-value-added">Economic Value Added</h3>

<p>Capital Employed represents the amount of financing that a business needs to run its operations. Assuming all the financing comes from either shareholders of debt holders, the cost of financing the business is WACCxCE.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Capital Employed allows the business to yield ROCExCE by definition of ROCE.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.102.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>The Economic Value Added is the difference between what the firm earns (ROCExCE) and the (opportunity) costs of running the business (WACCxCE).</p>

<p><b>Growth fallacy</b><br>
The difference ROCE - WACC is name the <strong>spread</strong>. It needs to be positive for the firm to create value for its shareholders. If the spread is negative, the firm is destroying value.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.103.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>One could be tempted to believe that by increasing the amount invested, earnings would mechanically grow.</p>

<p>This is indeed what suggests the linearity of the Economic Value Added formula. However, by increasing the business, the WACC may change (e.g. if the overall risk increases) and the ROCE is likely to evolve as well.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-is-worth-a-firm">How Much is Worth a Firm</h2>

<p>There are several popular valuation methods to assess the value of a project (including the acquisition of a company).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Valuation by comparable</strong> looks for similar firms, or firms specialized (focussed peers / proxy) into the same business and infer a price by comparison (usually as a multiple of EBITDA).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Discounted cash-flow</strong> (DCF) present value of the stream of cash flows.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Liquidation value</strong> amount of cash that the firm would receive if it would sell separately its various assets (trade receivable, inventories, equipment, land, buildings, etc). It is the minimum price you would have to pay for the firmâs assets</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Replacement value</strong> what it would cost today to replace the various firmâs assets. This is the maximum price you would accept to pay for the tangible assets. However, you may accept to pay more for some intangible assets controlled by the firm.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="free-cash-flow">Free Cash Flow</h3>

<p>The Free Cash Flow is a <em>flow</em> (i.e. computed over a period of time) that corresponds to the cash that the firm can allocate to the Capital owners (Equity or Debt holders).</p>

<p>The net cash position is a <em>stock</em>. The difference between the net cash position at two dates, is the free cash flow over the corresponding period.</p>

<p><b>Computing the Free Cash Flow of a project</b><br>
There are several ways to compute the Free Cash Flow associated with a project.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with assessing the effect of depreciation on taxes:</p>

<p>\[ EAT = EBIT - I - EBIT.T_r \]
\[EBIT.T_r = (EBITDA - DA).T_r = EBITDA.T_r - DA.T_r \]</p>

<p>Thus, if a project requires some &ldquo;capex&rdquo;, it will later produce a flow of Depreciation &amp; Amortisation (DA), which will reduce the total taxes in proportion.</p>

<p>The <strong>net cash inflows</strong> of a project consist therefore in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Operations</strong>: \( EBITDA \times (1 - T_r) \)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Impacts on taxes</strong>: \( DA \times T_r \)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>cash outflows</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Incremental Capex</strong> (yearly): \( \Delta Capex \)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Incremental WRC</strong> (yearly) Working Capital Requirement:  \( \Delta WCR \)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b> Discounted Cash Flow </b><br>
One of the most important decisions a manager can make is the capital investment decision: spending cash now to acquire long-lived assets that will generate cash flows in the future. Capital budgeting involves comparing the amount of cash spent today on an investment with the cash inflows in the future. As future cash inflows are spread over time, they must be converted into their equivalent today value.</p>

<p>Capital budgeting involves comparing the amount of cash spent today on an investment with the cash inflows in the future. As future cash inflows are spread over time, they must be converted into their equivalent today value. The present value is the discounted value of future cash flows (possibly including some risks associated with future payments).</p>

<p>Typical capital investment process: identify opportunities, estimate future cash flows and discount rate, assess the impact of tax treatment, select &amp; implement.</p>

<h3 id="valuation-through-dcf">Valuation through DCF</h3>

<p>The (present) value of any company yields from the series of its future Free Cash Flows. Assuming that the future cash flows can be assessed, it becomes easy to assess the value of a company.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.106.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<h4 id="infinite-annuity">Infinite annuity</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that the cash flows increase over time at a constant rate g. On the first year, it is \( C \), on the second it is \( C(1+g) \) and on the nth ii is \( C(1+G)^{n}\).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also assume that the discount rate d is constant. How much is the present value of this infinite series of annuities ?</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.107.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p><b>DCF Value</b><br>
The total DFC is the sum of the present value of the n first years plus the present value of the terminal value (computed on year n).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/3/3.108.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<h3 id="enterprise-value">Enterprise Value</h3>

<p>The enterprise value is an attempt to measure how much a business is worth. EV approximates a (theoretical) take over price. Actual transactions are usually not made at EV price, still it is common practice to provide EV for listed companies.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/figs/G/045.png"/> 
</figure>


<p>In theory, taking-over 100% of a company would require buying all the shares (at market value). With all the shares in hand, one would own the cash and the so called enterprise value, but would still have to repay the debts of the company</p>

<p>So Market Capitalization = EV + Cash - Debt.</p>

<p>In other words EV = MarketCap + Debt - Cash.</p>
